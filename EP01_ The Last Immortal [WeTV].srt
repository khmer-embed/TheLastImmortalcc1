What are you singing?

39
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,300
(Yin)

40
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:30,950
Yin,

41
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,110
why are you back again?

42
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,400
Yin?

43
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,750
I gave you a new life in the mortal world

44
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,670
only about 17 or 18 years ago

45
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,740
(Xiu Yan)
and I made you a princess.

46
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,780
Why was it over so soon?

47
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,460
Is it that even the imperial power

48
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,550
can't smother your bad luck?

49
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,510
Don't you remember what you said?

50
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,030
Before you sent me to the mortal world,
you promised

51
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,500
that I would enjoy a long and happy life.

52
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,340
But what happened?

53
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,020
My biological brother killed me.

54
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,230
Such a lousy life.

55
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,060
So, it's easy to bribe the King of Hell

56
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,120
while it's hard to bribe his subordinates.

57
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,870
This path,

58
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,510
I've experienced it over twenty times.

59
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,550
When can I stop doing this?

60
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,420
Who is he?

61
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,340
He looks distinguished.

62
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:34,980
What's so great about him?

63
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,420
But why does he look

64
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,580
so sad?

65
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:42,980
I know.

66
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,260
I heard a thousand years ago,

67
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,180
the female immortal he adored

68
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,940
fell in love with the Fox King.

69
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,500
She helped the Fox King

70
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,500
to destroy the Spirit Mountain
of the Immortal Realm

71
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,400
and started a war
between immortals and demons.

72
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,140
In front of all the armies,

73
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,100
he killed his beloved immortal

74
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,580
with his magic weapon.

75
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,260
So, every year, he comes here

76
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,860
to see if he can find

77
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,780
a little bit of residual spirit of hers.

78
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,020
He killed her

79
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,060
but still doesn't leave her alone.

80
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,220
Rather ruthless.

81
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,620
He's just seeking psychological comfort.

82
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:17,860
You're right.

83
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,340
He killed her, anyway.

84
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,420
Why would he not let it go?

85
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,100
If I were that female immortal,

86
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,620
I would never see him again,

87
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,660
alive or dead.

88
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:38,580
I should go.

89
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,540
By the way,

90
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,300
what is the name

91
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,460
of the female immortal

92
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,300
You Jun just mentioned?

93
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:49,860
Yin.

94
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,020
Her name, I mean.

95
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:01,780
Her name is

96
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:03,660
Yin.

97
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:19,180
(Yuan Qi)

98
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,020
Xiu Yan,

99
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,860
was that Yin?

100
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,300
Yin no longer exists in this world.

101
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:30,660
Don't you remember?

102
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,180
Your Spirit Sword is a supreme weapon.

103
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,940
How could anyone survive it?

104
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,020
It was just your hallucination.

105
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:52,940
Yin,

106
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,260
we will meet again.

107
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:13,220
(A thousand years ago)

108
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:16,580
(Wutong Island, the Immortal Realm)

109
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,420
- Senior brother.
- Senior brother.

110
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,100
I've mastered

111
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:49,940
the magic you taught me.

112
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,140
(Feng Yuan, Heavenly Empress
and Phoenix Queen)

113
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,180
Girl,

114
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,300
you've been nurtured in there
for a hundred years.

115
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,580
Finally, you're coming out.

116
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,020
The Three Realms
have been uneventful for so long.

117
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,660
It's time to have a celebration.

118
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,900
- Greetings, Your Majesty.
- Greetings, Your Majesty.

119
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,860
On our own island,

120
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,900
call me "Your Ladyship".

121
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,180
- Aye.
- Aye.

122
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,780
At my command, go tell the world

123
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,860
that we will hold a large banquet

124
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:19,980
to celebrate

125
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,780
the birth of the second Fire Phoenix.

126
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:31,340
(Daze Mountain, the Immortal Realm)

127
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:48,850
(Invitation)

128
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:51,000
(It is a great thing for Wutong Island
to have a second Fire Phoenix.)

129
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,900
(You're invited to come
for the celebration of her birth.)

130
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:57,660
(Donghua, Chief of Daze Mountain)
After the Ancestral God built the world,

131
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,060
a new Fire Phoenix was never born

132
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,540
until the old one died.

133
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,300
This has never happened before

134
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,220
that a Fire Phoenix is born

135
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,460
when the Phoenix Queen is still alive.

136
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,260
I guess Feng Yuan

137
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,140
can't wait to leave the Phoenix Clan

138
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,540
to the young Fire Phoenix

139
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,300
and then live a simple life herself.

140
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,460
- Greetings, Martial Uncle Xian Zhu.
- Greetings, Martial Uncle Xian Zhu.

141
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,700
(Xian Zhu, Disciple of Daze Mountain)
Master, the presents are ready.

142
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:36,060
Gu Jin is an old friend of the Phoenix Queen.

143
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,260
We'll send him.

144
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,300
It's about time.

145
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,540
Where is Gu Jin?

146
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,500
I sent my man searching.

147
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,300
(Zuixian Tavern, the Immortal Realm)

148
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,500
This is the Immortal Brew,

149
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,460
very rare wine.

150
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,260
Here's the last jar.

151
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:57,780
Guests,

152
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,420
make an offer.

153
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,140
I'll offer

154
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:05,340
a straw of Tortoise-snake Ganoderma
from Wanyi Island.

155
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,540
Eat it

156
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:09,630
(Ling Feng, Young Master of Wanyi Mountain)
and your life will be prolonged.

157
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,900
What's so great about that?

158
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,340
I'll offer something

159
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,180
that no one else will.

160
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,460
That is,

161
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,140
my cultivation base of 200 years.

162
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,580
Base of 200 years?

163
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,900
Base of 200 years?

164
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,180
Gu Jin,

165
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,900
you're just being
deliberately perverse, huh?

166
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,020
You bought all the Immortal Brew

167
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,380
every time it was sold.

168
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,660
Stop being so selfish, will you?

169
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,700
Whoever offers more

170
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,180
gets it.

171
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,860
(Gu Jin, Disciple of Daze Mountain)

172
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,660
I'm fine.

173
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,220
Who is he?

174
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:46,580
Madam,

175
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,260
I'm from Daze Mountain,

176
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,220
a decent immortal sect.

177
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,100
My spiritual power of 200 years

178
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,660
is enough for the wine, isn't it?

179
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,300
Deal.

180
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,380
Thank you.

181
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,860
Spiritual power of 200 years...

182
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,380
Gu Jin,

183
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,700
for some wine,

184
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,340
you don't even care
for the reputation of your sect.

185
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,060
How could Lord Donghua

186
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,340
have such a useless disciple like you?

187
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,940
Only someone who hasn't tasted it

188
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,900
would ask such a silly question.

189
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,700
Someone who tasted it would only say,

190
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:23,620
"Tastes great."

191
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,180
Have some taste.

192
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,260
Whatever.

193
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,380
Martial Uncle. Martial Uncle.

194
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,000
I've found you at last.

195
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,630
(Qing Yun, Disciple of Daze Mountain)
Oh, Qing Yun.

196
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:42,740
You're just in time.

197
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,500
Give the landlady

198
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:47,940
my cultivation base of 200 years.

199
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,640
200...

200
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,900
What? 200 years?

201
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:51,900
Madam, what...

202
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:54,700
Martial Uncle.

203
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,060
He's your new disciple?

204
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,460
Yes.

205
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,140
(Xian Shan, Disciple of Daze Mountain)
This young man has just become an immortal.

206
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,300
I thought he had some potential,

207
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,620
so I took him as my disciple.

208
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,420
All right. An immortal name for you,

209
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,580
Qing Yi.

210
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,380
(Qing Yi, Disciple of Daze Mountain)

211
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,540
Kneel and say thank you
to your grandmaster.

212
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,660
Thank you, Grandmaster.

213
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:21,900
You may rise.

214
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,060
Cultivate hard

215
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,860
and you will have a brilliant future.

216
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,460
On Daze Mountain,

217
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,660
you can learn from anyone

218
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,500
but your Martial Uncle Gu Jin

219
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,380
who is rather naughty.

220
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:35,780
Never

221
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,340
copy him.

222
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,980
Master, Grandmaster.

223
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:44,900
Grandmaster, I found Martial Uncle Gu Jin.

224
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:45,780
What happened to him?

225
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,020
On the Immortal Avenue,

226
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:48,980
he gambled for wine

227
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,460
and lost all his spiritual power

228
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,500
of 200 years.

229
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,700
What... What?

230
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,020
But he's only 200 years old.

231
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,500
Exactly.

232
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,100
I pleaded with the landlady

233
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,780
and gave her a lot of magic tools.

234
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,420
I didn't manage to get him back

235
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,860
until I promised her

236
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,300
that you would inscribe her tavern.

237
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,540
Ridiculous.

238
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,540
So naughty.

239
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:10,900
Master,

240
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,820
it's getting late.

241
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,940
Don't bother to punish him

242
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,900
before he's back from Wutong Island.

243
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:17,620
Well,

244
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,220
you can take the Snow-shaft Carriage.

245
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,540
Qing Yi.

246
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:22,820
You've just been here.

247
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,300
Go with your Martial Uncle

248
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,380
to broaden your vision.

249
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:26,820
Yes, Grandmaster.

250
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,300
Qing Yi,

251
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,260
watch your Martial Uncle.

252
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,620
Don't let him disgrace us.

253
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,500
Qing Yi,

254
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,140
you're so lucky.

255
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,460
As soon as you came,

256
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,180
you became a disciple of Daze Mountain.

257
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,300
Do you know we are

258
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,180
the first-class immortal sect?

259
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,700
First-class immortal sect?

260
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,380
So, are we the most powerful?

261
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,500
In the entire world,

262
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,300
ancient gods are the most powerful.

263
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,780
Below the God Realm

264
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:16,980
and above the Mortal Realm,

265
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,700
there are the Three Lower Realms,

266
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,900
the Immortal Realm, the Demon Realm,

267
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,900
and the Nether Realm.

268
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,220
The God Realm

269
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,900
is where true gods live.

270
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,660
You can't get up there

271
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,900
until you become a god.

272
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,780
But too bad.

273
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,900
The gate of the God Realm

274
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,940
hasn't been open for years.

275
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,340
I used to think

276
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,820
immortals were the best we could be.

277
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,100
I didn't know we could even be gods.

278
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,380
Then, are immortals

279
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,980
under the control of gods?

280
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,140
Yes.

281
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:43,740
And no.

282
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,860
Everything in this world

283
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,900
goes its own way.

284
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,260
The Three Realms

285
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,260
have their own rulers.

286
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:51,980
Gods

287
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,820
seldom interfere.

288
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:54,660
Master,

289
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,900
did you send Gu Jin to Wutong Island

290
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,740
because of his identity?

291
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,300
In the Three Lower Realms,

292
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,300
no one knows

293
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,860
Gu Jin is the son of two true gods

294
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,580
except you, the Heavenly Empress,

295
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,500
Chief of Qingchi Palace,

296
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,860
and me.

297
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,380
200 years ago,

298
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,060
the Destruction Tribulation appeared.

299
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,460
To save the world,

300
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,900
Yuan Qi's father True God Di Juan

301
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,300
sacrificed his life.

302
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,900
(Young Yuan Qi)
His mother True Goddess Yi He was so sad

303
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,620
that she sealed up the God Realm,

304
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,820
trying to get True God Di Juan back to life.

305
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,300
Yuan Qi was frustrated.

306
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:29,940
- For some unknown reason,
- Mother.

307
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:30,980
he lost all his god power.

308
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:31,900
Mother.

309
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:32,860
Then his mother

310
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,970
- sent him down here for experience.
- Don't leave me.

311
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,060
Fire Phoenix is the spirit beast of true gods.

312
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,180
The one to be born

313
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,140
is deeply related to Gu Jin.

314
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,660
So, this time,

315
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,420
he has to go personally.

316
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,140
Save the world?

317
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,500
It's awesome to be a god.

318
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,020
What's so great about being a god?

319
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,700
Quite cold.

320
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,300
Boring.

321
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:00,260
Martial Uncle, you've been there before?

322
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,060
No.

323
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:03,860
I guessed.

324
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:07,700
New immortal?

325
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:09,980
Yes, Martial Uncle.

326
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,060
Fine.

327
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,340
Since you call me Martial Uncle,

328
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,380
I'll look out for you.

329
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,180
Martial Uncle,

330
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,060
you've lost

331
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,460
your spiritual power of 200 years.

332
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,860
How can you look out for me?

333
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,620
Just a little power.

334
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,820
You'll know.

335
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,420
Immortals like us have nothing

336
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,540
but plenty of time.

337
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,780
Spiritual power of 200 years.

338
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,220
Soon, I can get it back.

339
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,500
I don't care.

340
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,580
Come on, Martial Uncle.

341
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:33,780
Don't mention it.

342
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,220
Master has got it back

343
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,540
for you.

344
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:38,780
Take it.

345
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,340
Thank you, Master.

346
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,500
You actually care, don't you?

347
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,260
Better than nothing.

348
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,100
Well,

349
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,580
if someone bullies you,

350
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,820
I may fail to protect you.

351
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,860
But speaking of seeking pleasure,

352
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,380
count on me.

353
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:58,660
Ling Feng,

354
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,020
isn't that the Snow-shaft Carriage

355
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,820
the late Heavenly Emperor
gave Lord Donghua?

356
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:03,500
His useless disciple

357
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,580
must be sitting in it.

358
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,220
Let's play a trick on him.

359
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,220
What's going on?

360
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,060
- The horse…
- Qing Yun,

361
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,060
stop the horse.

362
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:35,900
Ling Feng?

363
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,820
Oh, Wan Yi.

364
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:43,900
(Cangwu Hall, Wutong Island)

365
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,820
Long time no see.

366
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:46,980
Come on. Get in there.

367
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,300
Dragon King of the East Sea,

368
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,500
long time no see.

369
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,780
Come in, please.

370
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:23,300
(Feng Yin)

371
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:26,260
(This is the celebration of my birth.)

372
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,020
(I can't miss out on this.)

373
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,300
(No one can recognize me now.)

374
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:46,980
Your Majesty,

375
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,820
has the pretty wife for my nephew

376
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:49,780
come out?

377
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:50,940
How daring!

378
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,020
Demon Lord Hong Ruo,

379
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,260
this is a celebration of immortals.

380
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,540
How could you mess it up?

381
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,780
For your information, Dragon King,

382
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:56,980
Demon Lord Hong Ruo

383
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,500
has been an old friend of our queen.

384
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,100
She's here to give her blessing.

385
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,420
(Hong Ruo, Fox Queen)

386
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,140
The invitation

387
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,460
was sent to you three days ago.

388
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,820
What have you been doing these days?

389
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,500
When I was passing the sea

390
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,300
under the jurisdiction
of Dragon King Ao Lin,

391
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,980
I saw Nine-headed Snakes do the crime.

392
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,060
I had an itch

393
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,580
and killed them.

394
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,900
Dragon King,

395
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,540
- your jurisdiction isn't that safe.
- You!

396
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,440
- She satirized Dragon King in his face.
- Forget it.

397
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:24,850
Come on.

398
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,020
You're as tough as before.

399
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,980
Today is the day

400
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,180
Feng Yin will come out.

401
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,540
Don't forget.

402
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,740
Back on Jingyou Mountain,

403
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,420
you lost to me

404
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,620
and promised

405
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,660
I could pick any phoenix

406
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,580
to be my nephew's wife.

407
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,140
Look.

408
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,220
I've even brought

409
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,060
a betrothal present.

410
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,060
Even if you offered your whole clan

411
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,220
as the bride price,

412
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,140
that wouldn't be enough.

413
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,460
Now,

414
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,020
you try to kid me

415
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,260
with a mere core of a Nine-headed Snake.

416
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,460
Don't you fear I'd destroy your den?

417
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,700
It's just a welcome gift.

418
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,700
When Feng Yin becomes an adult,

419
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:09,020
I'll come with the betrothal gifts.

420
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,460
You're the Heavenly Empress.

421
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,020
Don't go back on your word.

422
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:15,780
Your Majesty,

423
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,740
you can't do this.

424
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,980
Fire Phoenix is our queen.

425
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,980
How can she marry a demon?

426
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:21,820
Yeah.

427
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,340
- This is ridiculous.
- She can't.

428
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,940
How can demons and immortals get married?

429
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:25,900
Who said I would marry

430
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,020
a female immortal?

431
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,340
(Hong Yi, Fox Queen's Nephew)

432
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,900
If I had known your purpose,

433
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,420
I wouldn't have come with you.

434
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:33,900
Hong Yi.

435
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,220
Don't make decisions for me.

436
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,580
Now, I don't want to get engaged.

437
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:38,900
Even if I did,

438
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,740
I could choose
from millions of female demons.

439
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:42,940
Isn't it better

440
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,520
than flattering the immortals?

441
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,380
Hong Yi,

442
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,300
don't be so rude.

443
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,660
(This demon is quite short-tempered.)

444
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,580
(Does he have a grudge against immortals?)

445
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,100
Your nephew

446
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,140
has your temper.

447
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,540
Young man,

448
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,100
even if you don't want to get married,

449
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,180
you shouldn't waste

450
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,740
your aunt's care for you.

451
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,100
You have to know,

452
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,700
the more you talk, the more you'll regret.

453
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:05,820
Are you leaving or not?

454
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:17,500
Hong Yi.

455
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,340
Hong Yi!

456
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,340
We're here, anyway.

457
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,660
Forget about the marriage thing.

458
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,500
There are also many powerful immortals

459
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,620
in the Immortal Realm.

460
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:29,830
If you can

461
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,840
make some friends

462
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:31,970
and learn from them,

463
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,120
your trip will be worthwhile.

464
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,140
Such a waste of time.

465
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:18,780
Are you all right?

466
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,380
Thank you.

467
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,260
- Martial Uncle.
- Martial Uncle.

468
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,500
Martial Uncle.

469
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,620
Is this the powerful immortal

470
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,540
you just talked about?

471
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,620
What can I learn from him?

472
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:36,860
Hong Yi,

473
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:37,900
don't be disrespectful.

474
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,340
Who are you?

475
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:40,940
What are you talking about?

476
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:41,780
None of your business.

477
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,180
What do you think you're doing?

478
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,100
Do you know

479
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,460
who you just

480
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,340
flung?

481
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:49,620
This is

482
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,020
a great disciple

483
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,940
of Lord Donghua on Daze Mountain.

484
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,180
If you dare,

485
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,580
have a competition with him.

486
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,180
No need.

487
00:22:58,820 --> 00:22:59,820
I don't want that.

488
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:00,940
I'm here for the banquet,

489
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,620
not the competition.

490
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,620
Are you leaving or not?

491
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,740
If you still want to stay

492
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:07,780
and flatter these immortals,

493
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,420
I'll go alone.

494
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,420
Hong Yi!

495
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:18,700
Don't go.

496
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,660
You hurt Lord Donghua's disciple.

497
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,940
You can't get away like this.

498
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,500
Young Master Ling Feng,

499
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,780
since when did you defend me like that?

500
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,860
I have something to say

501
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,100
to that demon.

502
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,460
If you catch up with him

503
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:32,140
and get him back,

504
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,500
I will give you

505
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,460
some Immortal Brew.

506
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,660
Are you sure?

507
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,180
You can do

508
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,540
the Cloud-sticking Trick.

509
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,260
Then I really wonder

510
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:00,100
why you need the Cloud-riding Talisman

511
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:01,940
on the bottom of your shoe.

512
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,260
You tricked me!

513
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,340
You burned my carriage, right?

514
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,380
- Yes. So what?
- Stop.

515
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:14,660
Jin,

516
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,780
Her Majesty is watching.

517
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,140
Don't make a fool.

518
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,820
All right, everybody. Go take your seat.

519
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,300
Go.

520
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,860
(Who is this man?)

521
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:35,020
(Cangwu Hall)

522
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,540
Peacock King Hua Mo

523
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,020
and Princess Hua Shu have arrived.

524
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,180
Get them in.

525
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:01,300
(Hua Mo, Peacock King)

526
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:05,460
(Hua Shu, Peacock Princess)

527
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,300
This is my daughter, Hua Shu.

528
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,660
Greetings, Your Majesty.

529
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,980
There's no need for that.

530
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:25,860
We haven't met for many years.

531
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,900
Your pretty daughter

532
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,900
has been more charming.

533
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:30,740
Thank you, Your Majesty.

534
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:32,940
Take your seats.

535
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,140
Qing Yun,

536
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,340
are all female immortals

537
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,620
so gorgeous?

538
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,780
No female immortal in this hall

539
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,500
can be as beautiful

540
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,540
as Hua Shu.

541
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,940
You regret being engaged with Bi Yun, huh?

542
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,340
Hua Shu is beautiful.

543
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,620
But if the young Fire Phoenix

544
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:53,740
is far more charming,

545
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,700
don't you need to break off again?

546
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,660
Right, I should think this through.

547
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,860
Peacocks are of a second-class immortal sect.

548
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,460
But they're always arrogant.

549
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:02,540
Look at her.

550
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:03,860
She wears the Elliptic Peacock Jade

551
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:04,940
to show off.

552
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,740
She doesn't know

553
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:09,260
there's a Fire Phoenix Jade
from True Goddess Yi He

554
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,580
and that's truly valuable.

555
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,380
When it appears,

556
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,300
the Elliptic Peacock Jade

557
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,620
will be eclipsed.

558
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,540
When the young Fire Phoenix is born,

559
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,540
no one will notice the peacock.

560
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,220
My guests,

561
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,340
cheers.

562
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,060
Instead of staying in the shell,

563
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,740
you fly around
with the Transformation Trick

564
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:10,940
I taught you.

565
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,020
Tell me.

566
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:13,940
Why did you fly out?

567
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:27,020
If I hadn't come out,

568
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,580
I wouldn't know

569
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,020
who you'd marry me to.

570
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,220
Oh, Master.

571
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,020
I'll make my own decision

572
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,220
in marriage.

573
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:35,940
No one can arrange anything for me.

574
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,980
I don't know

575
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,020
who you got this temper from.

576
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,020
You.

577
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,460
I have a question.

578
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,220
Are immortals

579
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,500
destined to be

580
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,060
inferior or superior?

581
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,660
Why do you ask?

582
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,140
I just met some female immortals.

583
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,620
They all want to marry someone powerful.

584
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,420
Some male immortals

585
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,260
are the same.

586
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:07,940
They compare family property

587
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,620
as if that was everything.

588
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,340
I don't quite understand.

589
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:14,340
Others can think this way,

590
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,660
but you can't.

591
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,740
Because you're born to be a queen.

592
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,620
How could you know what others suffer?

593
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,700
Then I've made up my mind.

594
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,460
I won't be a queen as soon as I'm born.

595
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,180
I'm going to travel around

596
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,500
and experience hardships in life

597
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:31,820
before I come back

598
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,420
and fairly compete with my clansmen

599
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,300
for the throne.

600
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,100
You think it's so easy

601
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,860
to take the throne?

602
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,260
Every Fire Phoenix

603
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,620
has to go through countless disasters.

604
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,460
You never know

605
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:46,780
what you'll have to suffer

606
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,060
after you're born.

607
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:52,940
(Abyssal Prison)

608
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:05,780
Master,

609
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,500
a lot of guests are on Wutong Island.

610
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,860
So, the barrier has been inactivated.

611
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,660
I can sneak in

612
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,740
and wait to kill.

613
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:14,820
In two hours,

614
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:18,460
(Zhuo Ying, Devil)
the Fire Phoenix will be born.

615
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,540
She must be

616
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,340
having the Fire Phoenix Jade.

617
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,500
It's been 200 years.

618
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,740
I've been waiting too long

619
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:28,460
for this day.

620
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,380
Immortals and demons

621
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:33,860
sealed me in the Abyssal Prison.

622
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,100
Feng Yuan was in on it, too.

623
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,780
(Qing Lin)

624
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,020
Snatch the Fire Phoenix Jade

625
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,100
and kill that young phoenix.

626
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,700
You promised

627
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,260
to propose to me on this year's birthday.

628
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,740
Why haven't you come yet?

629
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,500
Are you trying to get Hua Shu?

630
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,540
I saw you stare at her

631
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:51,820
even with your eyes sparkling.

632
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:54,330
I... I was eyeing her for Lei Che.

633
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,020
Where are Qing Yi and Qing Yun?

634
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,500
It's such a big garden.

635
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,380
What if they get lost?

636
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,140
Today, most young immortals came here

637
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,700
for the young Fire Phoenix.

638
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,260
But in my opinion,

639
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,540
you're just dreaming.

640
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,020
Fire Phoenix

641
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,340
is the spirit beast of true gods.

642
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,100
Except for Yuan Qi,

643
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,340
the only young god,

644
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:16,940
who else can be good enough for her?

645
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,300
He's a true god, but so what?

646
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:20,860
He's been living in the God Realm

647
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,180
and no one has seen him.

648
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,380
Maybe he's ugly

649
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,860
and the young Fire Phoenix won't like him.

650
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,300
How dare you slander a true god?

651
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,420
Don't be scared.

652
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,900
The gate of the God Realm is closed.

653
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,060
Besides,

654
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,180
Yuan Qi

655
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,460
just has a better family

656
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,300
than us.

657
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:36,780
But since he was born,

658
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,060
he's never got love from his parents.

659
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:39,140
Shh.

660
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,260
And I heard

661
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,700
a lot of things happened in the God Realm.

662
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,220
His mother Yi He

663
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,820
had a love affair

664
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,580
with an immortal.

665
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:48,660
Maybe,

666
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,580
Yuan Qi isn't their biological son.

667
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,020
True God Di Juan died

668
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,140
possibly because he realized

669
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,300
that Yuan Qi

670
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,780
wasn't his real son.

671
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,660
Out of anger, he jumped
into the Destruction Tribulation

672
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:59,140
and earned a reputation.

673
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,220
Shut up!

674
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:04,660
Who are you?

675
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,860
How dare you say that?

676
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:10,860
It's you again. None of your business!

677
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,900
True God Di Juan died for the world.

678
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,220
You aren't even qualified to talk about him.

679
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:17,500
I rule my own mouth.

680
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,900
- I can say whatever I like.
- Ling Feng...

681
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:28,620
Ling Feng, don't.

682
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,180
Ling Feng, stop.

683
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,700
With such little power,

684
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,940
you dare to defend a true god, huh?

685
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,740
You're in over your head!

686
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:43,820
Darn it!

687
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:44,900
Put me down!

688
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,420
Put him down.

689
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,860
He heard what you just said.

690
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:48,740
If this gets out,

691
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,780
we'll be in trouble.

692
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,380
Oh, you reminded me.

693
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,420
What are you doing?

694
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,620
He heard our conversation.

695
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,180
If I don't erase his memories,

696
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,540
he'll tell other people

697
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:00,540
and we'll be in trouble.

698
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:03,220
You aren't even a junior immortal yet.

699
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,340
Only a senior immortal

700
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,940
can use the Memory-erasure Trick.

701
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,300
If anything goes wrong,

702
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,460
you may hurt his spirit.

703
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,100
Don't worry.

704
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,260
I saw how my father used it.

705
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:12,620
It didn't look very hard.

706
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,440
I should at least
erase half of his memory.

707
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,420
Screw you!

708
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,580
Stop.

709
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,180
Who?

710
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:54,100
Who's interfering?

711
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,740
Put me down!

712
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,420
(Red dress?)

713
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,020
Ling Feng.

714
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:15,300
Are you Princess Hua Shu?

715
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,500
Hua Shu?

716
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,620
Your Highness,

717
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,220
Ling Feng just lost his mind.

718
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:21,140
He didn't really mean that.

719
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,260
Your Highness,

720
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,140
Gu Jin and I were just playing.

721
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,340
Don't take it seriously.

722
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,620
Princess Hua Shu?

723
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,940
A woman saved your life.

724
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,740
You must be too ashamed to tell others.

725
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:02,660
Your Highness.

726
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,100
Your Highness,

727
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:19,460
did you just help me out?

728
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,020
(So,)

729
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:23,580
(he mistook me)

730
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,300
(for the immortal in the corner.)

731
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,260
I'm Gu Jin from Daze Mountain.

732
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:31,700
Just a little favor.

733
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:32,760
It's not even worth mentioning.

734
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,300
So, it's really you.

735
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,100
Thank you for helping me out.

736
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,100
Some stain.

737
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,180
Thank you.

738
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:03,740
Without you, Your Highness,

739
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,420
I would have been injured today.

740
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:07,300
I will return the favor.

741
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:08,620
No need.

742
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,540
It's nothing. Forget it.

743
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:11,860
I can't.

744
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:13,900
Master told me

745
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,260
to be always grateful.

746
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:18,420
If you want anything, Your Highness,
let me know.

747
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,860
I will get it for you.

748
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:23,260
That's some tough talk.

749
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,140
(Hongque, Maid of the Peacock Clan)
Can you really get

750
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,540
whatever Her Highness wants?

751
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:27,980
Of course.

752
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,820
Fine. I've heard

753
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,460
the young Fire Phoenix has

754
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:33,300
the Fire Phoenix Jade from True Goddess Yi He.

755
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,540
This is

756
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,900
what you can't get.

757
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,460
Fire Phoenix Jade.

758
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,980
Is that what you want, Your Highness?

759
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,220
I just want to take a look.

760
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:48,100
You're young and inexperienced.

761
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,660
You shouldn't have promised casually.

762
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:50,740
Wait.

763
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:51,820
I... I can get it.

764
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,620
I'm on my way

765
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:54,620
to get the jade for you.

766
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:56,620
Farewell.

767
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,140
Your Highness...

768
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:04,580
Why did you admit

769
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,580
that you helped him?

770
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,300
But it wasn't you.

771
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,980
Daze Mountain will owe me.

772
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:12,380
Why would I reject that?

773
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,190
Maybe,

774
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:16,020
I'll need him someday.

775
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,900
(Sizzling Fire Barrier.)

776
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,540
(No wonder I couldn't break it,)

777
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,460
(however hard I try.)

778
00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:00,140
(His blood can break the barrier.)

779
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:42,660
Who are you?

780
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,180
What's going on?

781
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:55,860
I don't want your spiritual power.

782
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,580
Fire Phoenix Jade?

783
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,340
It's Feng Yin.

784
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:06,500
Martial Uncle.

785
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,020
All her immortal spirit

786
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:31,500
is gone.

787
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,300
Gone?

788
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,140
What?

789
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:39,700
Aunt...

790
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:41,660
Your Majesty.

791
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:43,660
Soul-burning Lamp.

792
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,260
I'll go with you.

793
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:32,860
Not even a smell

794
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:35,780
of Feng Yin's immortal spirit

795
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:37,660
is in the Three Realms.

796
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:41,700
I'm afraid...

797
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:44,940
She was smashed by the Fire Phoenix Jade

798
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:47,060
and fell into the turbulence
of time and space.

799
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,140
What were you doing here

800
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,620
in Feng Yin's habitat?

801
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:57,940
I was just trying

802
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:59,500
to see her Fire Phoenix Jade.

803
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,540
Why did you want to see that?

804
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,140
I...

805
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,140
I was out of the barrier.

806
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:12,420
I didn't know why,

807
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:13,380
but some force

808
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,900
pulled me into the barrier.

809
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:16,660
I... I controlled myself

810
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:17,740
with the Immortal-locking Spell.

811
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:18,740
But out of nowhere,

812
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:20,420
someone in black rushed out

813
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:22,220
and cut my Immortal-locking Rope.

814
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:23,420
So, I was pulled in here.

815
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,100
The Fire Phoenix Jade

816
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:26,620
seemed to be startled

817
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:27,780
and it suddenly exploded.

818
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,060
Go check it out

819
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:32,100
if this man is still on the island.

820
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,460
Your Majesty,

821
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:40,060
we have a Fire Phoenix
every tens of thousands of years.

822
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:43,300
Now, she's dead for no reason.

823
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:46,460
Please punish him
with the Bone-cutting Thunder Strike.

824
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,620
Yeah, Your Majesty.

825
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:52,340
He's Lord Donghua's disciple,

826
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:55,300
but he killed the queen of our clan.

827
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,020
We are

828
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:58,820
sworn enemies!

829
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:02,060
- We're sworn enemies!
- We're sworn enemies!

830
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:07,420
Your Majesty,

831
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,380
whatever I explain,

832
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:11,500
the young Fire Phoenix lost her life

833
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:13,860
because of my rash move.

834
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:17,420
I'm ready for any punishment.

835
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:19,820
Your Majesty,

836
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,020
please show some mercy.

837
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:22,340
No need.

838
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,300
Any punishment will do.

839
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:26,460
You...

840
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,740
How can I explain to your master

841
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:33,980
or your parents?

842
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:34,900
No matter who I am,

843
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:38,740
I have to answer for what I did.
