You Jun.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.340
What are you singing?

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.300
(Yin)

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.950
Yin,

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.110
why are you back again?

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.400
Yin?

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.750
I gave you a new life in the mortal world

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:38.670
only about 17 or 18 years ago

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.740
(Xiu Yan)
and I made you a princess.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:42.780
Why was it over so soon?

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.460
Is it that even the imperial power

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.550
can't smother your bad luck?

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.510
Don't you remember what you said?

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.030
Before you sent me to the mortal world,
you promised

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.500
that I would enjoy a long and happy life.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.340
But what happened?

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.020
My biological brother killed me.

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.230
Such a lousy life.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.060
So, it's easy to bribe the King of Hell

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.120
while it's hard to bribe his subordinates.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.870
This path,

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.510
I've experienced it over twenty times.

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.550
When can I stop doing this?

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.420
Who is he?

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.340
He looks distinguished.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:34.980
What's so great about him?

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.420
But why does he look

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.580
so sad?

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.980
I know.

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.260
I heard a thousand years ago,

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.180
the female immortal he adored

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.940
fell in love with the Fox King.

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:50.500
She helped the Fox King

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.500
to destroy the Spirit Mountain
of the Immortal Realm

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.400
and started a war
between immortals and demons.

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.140
In front of all the armies,

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.100
he killed his beloved immortal

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.580
with his magic weapon.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.260
So, every year, he comes here

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:03.860
to see if he can find

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.780
a little bit of residual spirit of hers.

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.020
He killed her

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.060
but still doesn't leave her alone.

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:12.220
Rather ruthless.

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.620
He's just seeking psychological comfort.

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.860
You're right.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.340
He killed her, anyway.

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:22.420
Why would he not let it go?

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.100
If I were that female immortal,

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:26.620
I would never see him again,

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.660
alive or dead.

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:38.580
I should go.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:43.540
By the way,

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.300
what is the name

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.460
of the female immortal

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:48.300
You Jun just mentioned?

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.860
Yin.

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.020
Her name, I mean.

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:01.780
Her name is

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:03.660
Yin.

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.180
(Yuan Qi)

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.020
Xiu Yan,

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:25.860
was that Yin?

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.300
Yin no longer exists in this world.

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:30.660
Don't you remember?

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.180
Your Spirit Sword is a supreme weapon.

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.940
How could anyone survive it?

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.020
It was just your hallucination.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.940
Yin,

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:55.260
we will meet again.

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:13.220
(A thousand years ago)

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:16.580
(Wutong Island, the Immortal Realm)

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:45.420
- Senior brother.
- Senior brother.

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.100
I've mastered

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:49.940
the magic you taught me.

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:45.140
(Feng Yuan, Heavenly Empress
and Phoenix Queen)

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:46.180
Girl,

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:48.300
you've been nurtured in there
for a hundred years.

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:50.580
Finally, you're coming out.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.020
The Three Realms
have been uneventful for so long.

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:55.660
It's time to have a celebration.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:04.900
- Greetings, Your Majesty.
- Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:08.860
On our own island,

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:10.900
call me "Your Ladyship".

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:12.180
- Aye.
- Aye.

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:16.780
At my command, go tell the world

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:18.860
that we will hold a large banquet

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:19.980
to celebrate

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:22.780
the birth of the second Fire Phoenix.

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:31.340
(Daze Mountain, the Immortal Realm)

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:48.850
(Invitation)

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:51.000
(It is a great thing for Wutong Island
to have a second Fire Phoenix.)

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.900
(You're invited to come
for the celebration of her birth.)

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:57.660
(Donghua, Chief of Daze Mountain)
After the Ancestral God built the world,

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:00.060
a new Fire Phoenix was never born

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:01.540
until the old one died.

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:04.300
This has never happened before

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.220
that a Fire Phoenix is born

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:08.460
when the Phoenix Queen is still alive.

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:11.260
I guess Feng Yuan

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.140
can't wait to leave the Phoenix Clan

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:14.540
to the young Fire Phoenix

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:17.300
and then live a simple life herself.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.460
- Greetings, Martial Uncle Xian Zhu.
- Greetings, Martial Uncle Xian Zhu.

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:33.700
(Xian Zhu, Disciple of Daze Mountain)
Master, the presents are ready.

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:36.060
Gu Jin is an old friend of the Phoenix Queen.

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:38.260
We'll send him.

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:41.300
It's about time.

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:43.540
Where is Gu Jin?

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:47.500
I sent my man searching.

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:50.300
(Zuixian Tavern, the Immortal Realm)

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:53.500
This is the Immortal Brew,

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:54.460
very rare wine.

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:56.260
Here's the last jar.

00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:57.780
Guests,

00:09:58.540 --> 00:09:59.420
make an offer.

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:01.140
I'll offer

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:05.340
a straw of Tortoise-snake Ganoderma
from Wanyi Island.

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:06.540
Eat it

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:09.630
(Ling Feng, Young Master of Wanyi Mountain)
and your life will be prolonged.

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:11.900
What's so great about that?

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:13.340
I'll offer something

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:15.180
that no one else will.

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:16.460
That is,

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:19.140
my cultivation base of 200 years.

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:20.580
Base of 200 years?

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:21.900
Base of 200 years?

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:26.180
Gu Jin,

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:27.900
you're just being
deliberately perverse, huh?

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:29.020
You bought all the Immortal Brew

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:30.380
every time it was sold.

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:31.660
Stop being so selfish, will you?

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:34.700
Whoever offers more

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:36.180
gets it.

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:37.860
(Gu Jin, Disciple of Daze Mountain)

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:43.660
I'm fine.

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:45.220
Who is he?

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:46.580
Madam,

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:49.260
I'm from Daze Mountain,

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:51.220
a decent immortal sect.

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:53.100
My spiritual power of 200 years

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:54.660
is enough for the wine, isn't it?

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:56.300
Deal.

00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:57.380
Thank you.

00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:58.860
Spiritual power of 200 years...

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:04.380
Gu Jin,

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:05.700
for some wine,

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:07.340
you don't even care
for the reputation of your sect.

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:14.060
How could Lord Donghua

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:15.340
have such a useless disciple like you?

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:17.940
Only someone who hasn't tasted it

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:19.900
would ask such a silly question.

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:21.700
Someone who tasted it would only say,

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:23.620
"Tastes great."

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:25.180
Have some taste.

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:31.260
Whatever.

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:38.380
Martial Uncle. Martial Uncle.

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:40.000
I've found you at last.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.630
(Qing Yun, Disciple of Daze Mountain)
Oh, Qing Yun.

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:42.740
You're just in time.

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:46.500
Give the landlady

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:47.940
my cultivation base of 200 years.

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:49.640
200...

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:50.900
What? 200 years?

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:51.900
Madam, what...

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:54.700
Martial Uncle.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.060
He's your new disciple?

00:11:58.620 --> 00:11:59.460
Yes.

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:02.140
(Xian Shan, Disciple of Daze Mountain)
This young man has just become an immortal.

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:03.300
I thought he had some potential,

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:04.620
so I took him as my disciple.

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:08.420
All right. An immortal name for you,

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:09.580
Qing Yi.

00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:12.380
(Qing Yi, Disciple of Daze Mountain)

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:15.540
Kneel and say thank you
to your grandmaster.

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:18.660
Thank you, Grandmaster.

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:21.900
You may rise.

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:26.060
Cultivate hard

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:27.860
and you will have a brilliant future.

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:30.460
On Daze Mountain,

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:31.660
you can learn from anyone

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:33.500
but your Martial Uncle Gu Jin

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:34.380
who is rather naughty.

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:35.780
Never

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:37.340
copy him.

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:38.980
Master, Grandmaster.

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:44.900
Grandmaster, I found Martial Uncle Gu Jin.

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:45.780
What happened to him?

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:48.020
On the Immortal Avenue,

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:48.980
he gambled for wine

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:50.460
and lost all his spiritual power

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:51.500
of 200 years.

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:53.700
What... What?

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:56.020
But he's only 200 years old.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:57.500
Exactly.

00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:59.100
I pleaded with the landlady

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:00.780
and gave her a lot of magic tools.

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:02.420
I didn't manage to get him back

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:03.860
until I promised her

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:05.300
that you would inscribe her tavern.

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:07.540
Ridiculous.

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:08.540
So naughty.

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:10.900
Master,

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:12.820
it's getting late.

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:13.940
Don't bother to punish him

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:15.900
before he's back from Wutong Island.

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:17.620
Well,

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:19.220
you can take the Snow-shaft Carriage.

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:21.540
Qing Yi.

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:22.820
You've just been here.

00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:24.300
Go with your Martial Uncle

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:25.380
to broaden your vision.

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:26.820
Yes, Grandmaster.

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:28.300
Qing Yi,

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.260
watch your Martial Uncle.

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:32.620
Don't let him disgrace us.

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:55.500
Qing Yi,

00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:58.140
you're so lucky.

00:13:58.500 --> 00:13:59.460
As soon as you came,

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:01.180
you became a disciple of Daze Mountain.

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:03.300
Do you know we are

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:05.180
the first-class immortal sect?

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:06.700
First-class immortal sect?

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:08.380
So, are we the most powerful?

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:12.500
In the entire world,

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:14.300
ancient gods are the most powerful.

00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:15.780
Below the God Realm

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:16.980
and above the Mortal Realm,

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:18.700
there are the Three Lower Realms,

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:19.900
the Immortal Realm, the Demon Realm,

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:20.900
and the Nether Realm.

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:22.220
The God Realm

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:23.900
is where true gods live.

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:25.660
You can't get up there

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:26.900
until you become a god.

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:28.780
But too bad.

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:30.900
The gate of the God Realm

00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:32.940
hasn't been open for years.

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:34.340
I used to think

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:35.820
immortals were the best we could be.

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:37.100
I didn't know we could even be gods.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:39.380
Then, are immortals

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:40.980
under the control of gods?

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:42.140
Yes.

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:43.740
And no.

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:45.860
Everything in this world

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:47.900
goes its own way.

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:49.260
The Three Realms

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:50.260
have their own rulers.

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:51.980
Gods

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:53.820
seldom interfere.

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:54.660
Master,

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:56.900
did you send Gu Jin to Wutong Island

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:58.740
because of his identity?

00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:01.300
In the Three Lower Realms,

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:03.300
no one knows

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:04.860
Gu Jin is the son of two true gods

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:06.580
except you, the Heavenly Empress,

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:08.500
Chief of Qingchi Palace,

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:10.860
and me.

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:13.380
200 years ago,

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:15.060
the Destruction Tribulation appeared.

00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:16.460
To save the world,

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:17.900
Yuan Qi's father True God Di Juan

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:19.300
sacrificed his life.

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:21.900
(Young Yuan Qi)
His mother True Goddess Yi He was so sad

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:23.620
that she sealed up the God Realm,

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:25.820
trying to get True God Di Juan back to life.

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:28.300
Yuan Qi was frustrated.

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:29.940
- For some unknown reason,
- Mother.

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:30.980
he lost all his god power.

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:31.900
Mother.

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:32.860
Then his mother

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:35.970
- sent him down here for experience.
- Don't leave me.

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:41.060
Fire Phoenix is the spirit beast of true gods.

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:43.180
The one to be born

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:45.140
is deeply related to Gu Jin.

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:46.660
So, this time,

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:48.420
he has to go personally.

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:50.140
Save the world?

00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:51.500
It's awesome to be a god.

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:54.020
What's so great about being a god?

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:55.700
Quite cold.

00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:57.300
Boring.

00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:00.260
Martial Uncle, you've been there before?

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:02.060
No.

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:03.860
I guessed.

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:07.700
New immortal?

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:09.980
Yes, Martial Uncle.

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:11.060
Fine.

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:13.340
Since you call me Martial Uncle,

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:15.380
I'll look out for you.

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:17.180
Martial Uncle,

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.060
you've lost

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:19.460
your spiritual power of 200 years.

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:20.860
How can you look out for me?

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:22.620
Just a little power.

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:24.820
You'll know.

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:26.420
Immortals like us have nothing

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:27.540
but plenty of time.

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:28.780
Spiritual power of 200 years.

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:30.220
Soon, I can get it back.

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:31.500
I don't care.

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:32.580
Come on, Martial Uncle.

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:33.780
Don't mention it.

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:36.220
Master has got it back

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:37.540
for you.

00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:38.780
Take it.

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:42.340
Thank you, Master.

00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:45.500
You actually care, don't you?

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:48.260
Better than nothing.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:51.100
Well,

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:52.580
if someone bullies you,

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:53.820
I may fail to protect you.

00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:55.860
But speaking of seeking pleasure,

00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:57.380
count on me.

00:16:57.820 --> 00:16:58.660
Ling Feng,

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:00.020
isn't that the Snow-shaft Carriage

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:01.820
the late Heavenly Emperor
gave Lord Donghua?

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:03.500
His useless disciple

00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:04.580
must be sitting in it.

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:07.220
Let's play a trick on him.

00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:23.220
What's going on?

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:25.060
- The horse…
- Qing Yun,

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:26.060
stop the horse.

00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:35.900
Ling Feng?

00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:42.820
Oh, Wan Yi.

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:43.900
(Cangwu Hall, Wutong Island)

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:45.820
Long time no see.

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:46.980
Come on. Get in there.

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:51.300
Dragon King of the East Sea,

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:52.500
long time no see.

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:53.780
Come in, please.

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:23.300
(Feng Yin)

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:26.260
(This is the celebration of my birth.)

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:29.020
(I can't miss out on this.)

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:36.300
(No one can recognize me now.)

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:46.980
Your Majesty,

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:48.820
has the pretty wife for my nephew

00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:49.780
come out?

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:50.940
How daring!

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:52.020
Demon Lord Hong Ruo,

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:53.260
this is a celebration of immortals.

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:54.540
How could you mess it up?

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:55.780
For your information, Dragon King,

00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:56.980
Demon Lord Hong Ruo

00:18:56.980 --> 00:18:58.500
has been an old friend of our queen.

00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:00.100
She's here to give her blessing.

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:01.420
(Hong Ruo, Fox Queen)

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:03.140
The invitation

00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:05.460
was sent to you three days ago.

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:08.820
What have you been doing these days?

00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:10.500
When I was passing the sea

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:12.300
under the jurisdiction
of Dragon King Ao Lin,

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:13.980
I saw Nine-headed Snakes do the crime.

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:15.060
I had an itch

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:16.580
and killed them.

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:19.900
Dragon King,

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:22.540
- your jurisdiction isn't that safe.
- You!

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:24.440
- She satirized Dragon King in his face.
- Forget it.

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:24.850
Come on.

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:27.020
You're as tough as before.

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:28.980
Today is the day

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:30.180
Feng Yin will come out.

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:31.540
Don't forget.

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:33.740
Back on Jingyou Mountain,

00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:35.420
you lost to me

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:36.620
and promised

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:37.660
I could pick any phoenix

00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:39.580
to be my nephew's wife.

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:41.140
Look.

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:43.220
I've even brought

00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:44.060
a betrothal present.

00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:46.060
Even if you offered your whole clan

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:47.220
as the bride price,

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:48.140
that wouldn't be enough.

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:49.460
Now,

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:51.020
you try to kid me

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:52.260
with a mere core of a Nine-headed Snake.

00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:54.460
Don't you fear I'd destroy your den?

00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:56.700
It's just a welcome gift.

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:06.700
When Feng Yin becomes an adult,

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:09.020
I'll come with the betrothal gifts.

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:11.460
You're the Heavenly Empress.

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:13.020
Don't go back on your word.

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:15.780
Your Majesty,

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:16.740
you can't do this.

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:18.980
Fire Phoenix is our queen.

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:20.980
How can she marry a demon?

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:21.820
Yeah.

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:23.340
- This is ridiculous.
- She can't.

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:24.940
How can demons and immortals get married?

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:25.900
Who said I would marry

00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:27.020
a female immortal?

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:29.340
(Hong Yi, Fox Queen's Nephew)

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:30.900
If I had known your purpose,

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:32.420
I wouldn't have come with you.

00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:33.900
Hong Yi.

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:35.220
Don't make decisions for me.

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:37.580
Now, I don't want to get engaged.

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:38.900
Even if I did,

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:40.740
I could choose
from millions of female demons.

00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:42.940
Isn't it better

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:44.520
than flattering the immortals?

00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:45.380
Hong Yi,

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:46.300
don't be so rude.

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:48.660
(This demon is quite short-tempered.)

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:50.580
(Does he have a grudge against immortals?)

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:52.100
Your nephew

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:54.140
has your temper.

00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:56.540
Young man,

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:58.100
even if you don't want to get married,

00:20:58.340 --> 00:20:59.180
you shouldn't waste

00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:00.740
your aunt's care for you.

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:02.100
You have to know,

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:03.700
the more you talk, the more you'll regret.

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:05.820
Are you leaving or not?

00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:17.500
Hong Yi.

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:20.340
Hong Yi!

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:24.340
We're here, anyway.

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:25.660
Forget about the marriage thing.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.500
There are also many powerful immortals

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:28.620
in the Immortal Realm.

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:29.830
If you can

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:30.840
make some friends

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:31.970
and learn from them,

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:33.120
your trip will be worthwhile.

00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:35.140
Such a waste of time.

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:18.780
Are you all right?

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:21.380
Thank you.

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:28.260
- Martial Uncle.
- Martial Uncle.

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:29.500
Martial Uncle.

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:30.620
Is this the powerful immortal

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:32.540
you just talked about?

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:35.620
What can I learn from him?

00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:36.860
Hong Yi,

00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:37.900
don't be disrespectful.

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:39.340
Who are you?

00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:40.940
What are you talking about?

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:41.780
None of your business.

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:44.180
What do you think you're doing?

00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:46.100
Do you know

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:47.460
who you just

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:48.340
flung?

00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:49.620
This is

00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:51.020
a great disciple

00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:52.940
of Lord Donghua on Daze Mountain.

00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:54.180
If you dare,

00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:55.580
have a competition with him.

00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:58.180
No need.

00:22:58.820 --> 00:22:59.820
I don't want that.

00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:00.940
I'm here for the banquet,

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:02.620
not the competition.

00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:05.620
Are you leaving or not?

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:06.740
If you still want to stay

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:07.780
and flatter these immortals,

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:09.420
I'll go alone.

00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:11.420
Hong Yi!

00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:18.700
Don't go.

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:20.660
You hurt Lord Donghua's disciple.

00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:21.940
You can't get away like this.

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:25.500
Young Master Ling Feng,

00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:26.780
since when did you defend me like that?

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:27.860
I have something to say

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:29.100
to that demon.

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:30.460
If you catch up with him

00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:32.140
and get him back,

00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:33.500
I will give you

00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:35.460
some Immortal Brew.

00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:37.660
Are you sure?

00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:54.180
You can do

00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:55.540
the Cloud-sticking Trick.

00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:57.260
Then I really wonder

00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:00.100
why you need the Cloud-riding Talisman

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:01.940
on the bottom of your shoe.

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:08.260
You tricked me!

00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:10.340
You burned my carriage, right?

00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:11.380
- Yes. So what?
- Stop.

00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:14.660
Jin,

00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:15.780
Her Majesty is watching.

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:17.140
Don't make a fool.

00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:26.820
All right, everybody. Go take your seat.

00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:29.300
Go.

00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:31.860
(Who is this man?)

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:35.020
(Cangwu Hall)

00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:45.540
Peacock King Hua Mo

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:47.020
and Princess Hua Shu have arrived.

00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:49.180
Get them in.

00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:01.300
(Hua Mo, Peacock King)

00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:05.460
(Hua Shu, Peacock Princess)

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:17.300
This is my daughter, Hua Shu.

00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:19.660
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:22.980
There's no need for that.

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:25.860
We haven't met for many years.

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:27.900
Your pretty daughter

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:29.900
has been more charming.

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:30.740
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:32.940
Take your seats.

00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:36.140
Qing Yun,

00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:38.340
are all female immortals

00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:39.620
so gorgeous?

00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:41.780
No female immortal in this hall

00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:43.500
can be as beautiful

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:44.540
as Hua Shu.

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:46.940
You regret being engaged with Bi Yun, huh?

00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:50.340
Hua Shu is beautiful.

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:52.620
But if the young Fire Phoenix

00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:53.740
is far more charming,

00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:55.700
don't you need to break off again?

00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:57.660
Right, I should think this through.

00:25:57.940 --> 00:25:59.860
Peacocks are of a second-class immortal sect.

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:01.460
But they're always arrogant.

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:02.540
Look at her.

00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:03.860
She wears the Elliptic Peacock Jade

00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:04.940
to show off.

00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:06.740
She doesn't know

00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:09.260
there's a Fire Phoenix Jade
from True Goddess Yi He

00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:10.580
and that's truly valuable.

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:12.380
When it appears,

00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:13.300
the Elliptic Peacock Jade

00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:14.620
will be eclipsed.

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:16.540
When the young Fire Phoenix is born,

00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:18.540
no one will notice the peacock.

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:24.220
My guests,

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:25.340
cheers.

00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:08.060
Instead of staying in the shell,

00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:09.740
you fly around
with the Transformation Trick

00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:10.940
I taught you.

00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:12.020
Tell me.

00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:13.940
Why did you fly out?

00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:27.020
If I hadn't come out,

00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:28.580
I wouldn't know

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:30.020
who you'd marry me to.

00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:31.220
Oh, Master.

00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:33.020
I'll make my own decision

00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:34.220
in marriage.

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:35.940
No one can arrange anything for me.

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:37.980
I don't know

00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:40.020
who you got this temper from.

00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:41.020
You.

00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:50.460
I have a question.

00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:53.220
Are immortals

00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:55.500
destined to be

00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:57.060
inferior or superior?

00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:58.660
Why do you ask?

00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:01.140
I just met some female immortals.

00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:03.620
They all want to marry someone powerful.

00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:05.420
Some male immortals

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:06.260
are the same.

00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:07.940
They compare family property

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:10.620
as if that was everything.

00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:12.340
I don't quite understand.

00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:14.340
Others can think this way,

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:15.660
but you can't.

00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:17.740
Because you're born to be a queen.

00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:19.620
How could you know what others suffer?

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:22.700
Then I've made up my mind.

00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:25.460
I won't be a queen as soon as I'm born.

00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:28.180
I'm going to travel around

00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:29.500
and experience hardships in life

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:31.820
before I come back

00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:33.420
and fairly compete with my clansmen

00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:34.300
for the throne.

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:36.100
You think it's so easy

00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:37.860
to take the throne?

00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:40.260
Every Fire Phoenix

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:42.620
has to go through countless disasters.

00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:45.460
You never know

00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:46.780
what you'll have to suffer

00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:48.060
after you're born.

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:52.940
(Abyssal Prison)

00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:05.780
Master,

00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:07.500
a lot of guests are on Wutong Island.

00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:09.860
So, the barrier has been inactivated.

00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:11.660
I can sneak in

00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:12.740
and wait to kill.

00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:14.820
In two hours,

00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:18.460
(Zhuo Ying, Devil)
the Fire Phoenix will be born.

00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:20.540
She must be

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:22.340
having the Fire Phoenix Jade.

00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:24.500
It's been 200 years.

00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:26.740
I've been waiting too long

00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:28.460
for this day.

00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:31.380
Immortals and demons

00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:33.860
sealed me in the Abyssal Prison.

00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:36.100
Feng Yuan was in on it, too.

00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:38.780
(Qing Lin)

00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:40.020
Snatch the Fire Phoenix Jade

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:42.100
and kill that young phoenix.

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:43.700
You promised

00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:45.260
to propose to me on this year's birthday.

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:46.740
Why haven't you come yet?

00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:48.500
Are you trying to get Hua Shu?

00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:50.540
I saw you stare at her

00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:51.820
even with your eyes sparkling.

00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:54.330
I... I was eyeing her for Lei Che.

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:57.020
Where are Qing Yi and Qing Yun?

00:29:58.220 --> 00:29:59.500
It's such a big garden.

00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:01.380
What if they get lost?

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:04.140
Today, most young immortals came here

00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:05.700
for the young Fire Phoenix.

00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:07.260
But in my opinion,

00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:09.540
you're just dreaming.

00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:11.020
Fire Phoenix

00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:12.340
is the spirit beast of true gods.

00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:14.100
Except for Yuan Qi,

00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:15.340
the only young god,

00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:16.940
who else can be good enough for her?

00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:18.300
He's a true god, but so what?

00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:20.860
He's been living in the God Realm

00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:22.180
and no one has seen him.

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:24.380
Maybe he's ugly

00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:25.860
and the young Fire Phoenix won't like him.

00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:28.300
How dare you slander a true god?

00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:29.420
Don't be scared.

00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:30.900
The gate of the God Realm is closed.

00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:32.060
Besides,

00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:33.180
Yuan Qi

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:34.460
just has a better family

00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:35.300
than us.

00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:36.780
But since he was born,

00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:38.060
he's never got love from his parents.

00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:39.140
Shh.

00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:40.260
And I heard

00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:42.700
a lot of things happened in the God Realm.

00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:44.220
His mother Yi He

00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:45.820
had a love affair

00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:47.580
with an immortal.

00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:48.660
Maybe,

00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:50.580
Yuan Qi isn't their biological son.

00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:52.020
True God Di Juan died

00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:53.140
possibly because he realized

00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:54.300
that Yuan Qi

00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:55.780
wasn't his real son.

00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:57.660
Out of anger, he jumped
into the Destruction Tribulation

00:30:57.660 --> 00:30:59.140
and earned a reputation.

00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:00.220
Shut up!

00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:04.660
Who are you?

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:08.860
How dare you say that?

00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:10.860
It's you again. None of your business!

00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:12.900
True God Di Juan died for the world.

00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:15.220
You aren't even qualified to talk about him.

00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:17.500
I rule my own mouth.

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:18.900
- I can say whatever I like.
- Ling Feng...

00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:28.620
Ling Feng, don't.

00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:38.180
Ling Feng, stop.

00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:39.700
With such little power,

00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:40.940
you dare to defend a true god, huh?

00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:42.740
You're in over your head!

00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:43.820
Darn it!

00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:44.900
Put me down!

00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:46.420
Put him down.

00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:47.860
He heard what you just said.

00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:48.740
If this gets out,

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:49.780
we'll be in trouble.

00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:51.380
Oh, you reminded me.

00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:54.420
What are you doing?

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:56.620
He heard our conversation.

00:31:56.860 --> 00:31:58.180
If I don't erase his memories,

00:31:58.420 --> 00:31:59.540
he'll tell other people

00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:00.540
and we'll be in trouble.

00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:03.220
You aren't even a junior immortal yet.

00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:04.340
Only a senior immortal

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:05.940
can use the Memory-erasure Trick.

00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:07.300
If anything goes wrong,

00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:08.460
you may hurt his spirit.

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:10.100
Don't worry.

00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:11.260
I saw how my father used it.

00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:12.620
It didn't look very hard.

00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:14.440
I should at least
erase half of his memory.

00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:15.420
Screw you!

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:23.580
Stop.

00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:44.180
Who?

00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:54.100
Who's interfering?

00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:56.740
Put me down!

00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:07.420
(Red dress?)

00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:11.020
Ling Feng.

00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:15.300
Are you Princess Hua Shu?

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:16.500
Hua Shu?

00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:18.620
Your Highness,

00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:20.220
Ling Feng just lost his mind.

00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:21.140
He didn't really mean that.

00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:23.260
Your Highness,

00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:25.140
Gu Jin and I were just playing.

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:26.340
Don't take it seriously.

00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:36.620
Princess Hua Shu?

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:44.940
A woman saved your life.

00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:46.740
You must be too ashamed to tell others.

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:02.660
Your Highness.

00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:18.100
Your Highness,

00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:19.460
did you just help me out?

00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:22.020
(So,)

00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:23.580
(he mistook me)

00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:25.300
(for the immortal in the corner.)

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:28.260
I'm Gu Jin from Daze Mountain.

00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:31.700
Just a little favor.

00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:32.760
It's not even worth mentioning.

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:34.300
So, it's really you.

00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:37.100
Thank you for helping me out.

00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:46.100
Some stain.

00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:51.180
Thank you.

00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:03.740
Without you, Your Highness,

00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:05.420
I would have been injured today.

00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:07.300
I will return the favor.

00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:08.620
No need.

00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:10.540
It's nothing. Forget it.

00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:11.860
I can't.

00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:13.900
Master told me

00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:16.260
to be always grateful.

00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:18.420
If you want anything, Your Highness,
let me know.

00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:19.860
I will get it for you.

00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:23.260
That's some tough talk.

00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:25.140
(Hongque, Maid of the Peacock Clan)
Can you really get

00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:26.540
whatever Her Highness wants?

00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:27.980
Of course.

00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:29.820
Fine. I've heard

00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:31.460
the young Fire Phoenix has

00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:33.300
the Fire Phoenix Jade from True Goddess Yi He.

00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:34.540
This is

00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:35.900
what you can't get.

00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:39.460
Fire Phoenix Jade.

00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:42.980
Is that what you want, Your Highness?

00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:45.220
I just want to take a look.

00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:48.100
You're young and inexperienced.

00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:49.660
You shouldn't have promised casually.

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:50.740
Wait.

00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:51.820
I... I can get it.

00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:53.620
I'm on my way

00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:54.620
to get the jade for you.

00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:56.620
Farewell.

00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:02.140
Your Highness...

00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:04.580
Why did you admit

00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:05.580
that you helped him?

00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:07.300
But it wasn't you.

00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:09.980
Daze Mountain will owe me.

00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:12.380
Why would I reject that?

00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:14.190
Maybe,

00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:16.020
I'll need him someday.

00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:23.900
(Sizzling Fire Barrier.)

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:25.540
(No wonder I couldn't break it,)

00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:26.460
(however hard I try.)

00:36:57.380 --> 00:37:00.140
(His blood can break the barrier.)

00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:42.660
Who are you?

00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:54.180
What's going on?

00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:55.860
I don't want your spiritual power.

00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:24.580
Fire Phoenix Jade?

00:38:57.300 --> 00:38:58.340
It's Feng Yin.

00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:06.500
Martial Uncle.

00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:29.020
All her immortal spirit

00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:31.500
is gone.

00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:33.300
Gone?

00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:34.140
What?

00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:39.700
Aunt...

00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:41.660
Your Majesty.

00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:43.660
Soul-burning Lamp.

00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:54.260
I'll go with you.

00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:32.860
Not even a smell

00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:35.780
of Feng Yin's immortal spirit

00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:37.660
is in the Three Realms.

00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:41.700
I'm afraid...

00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:44.940
She was smashed by the Fire Phoenix Jade

00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:47.060
and fell into the turbulence
of time and space.

00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:55.140
What were you doing here

00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:56.620
in Feng Yin's habitat?

00:40:57.020 --> 00:40:57.940
I was just trying

00:40:57.940 --> 00:40:59.500
to see her Fire Phoenix Jade.

00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:01.540
Why did you want to see that?

00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:05.140
I...

00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:11.140
I was out of the barrier.

00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:12.420
I didn't know why,

00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:13.380
but some force

00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:14.900
pulled me into the barrier.

00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:16.660
I... I controlled myself

00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:17.740
with the Immortal-locking Spell.

00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:18.740
But out of nowhere,

00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:20.420
someone in black rushed out

00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:22.220
and cut my Immortal-locking Rope.

00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:23.420
So, I was pulled in here.

00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:25.100
The Fire Phoenix Jade

00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:26.620
seemed to be startled

00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:27.780
and it suddenly exploded.

00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:30.060
Go check it out

00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:32.100
if this man is still on the island.

00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:35.460
Your Majesty,

00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:40.060
we have a Fire Phoenix
every tens of thousands of years.

00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:43.300
Now, she's dead for no reason.

00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:46.460
Please punish him
with the Bone-cutting Thunder Strike.

00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:49.620
Yeah, Your Majesty.

00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:52.340
He's Lord Donghua's disciple,

00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:55.300
but he killed the queen of our clan.

00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:57.020
We are

00:41:57.660 --> 00:41:58.820
sworn enemies!

00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:02.060
- We're sworn enemies!
- We're sworn enemies!

00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:07.420
Your Majesty,

00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:09.380
whatever I explain,

00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:11.500
the young Fire Phoenix lost her life

00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:13.860
because of my rash move.

00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:17.420
I'm ready for any punishment.

00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:19.820
Your Majesty,

00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:21.020
please show some mercy.

00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:22.340
No need.

00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:25.300
Any punishment will do.

00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:26.460
You...

00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:31.740
How can I explain to your master

00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:33.980
or your parents?

00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:34.900
No matter who I am,

00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:38.740
I have to answer for what I did.
