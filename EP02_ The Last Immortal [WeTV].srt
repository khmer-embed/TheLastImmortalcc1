Please show some mercy.

00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:51,180
Your Majesty.

32
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,020
All elders.

33
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,620
I foresaw

34
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,820
that my disciple was naughty

35
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:56,900
and had gotten into trouble.

36
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:57,980
That's why I'm here.

37
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,340
I'd like to ask all of you

38
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,940
to give him a chance

39
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,140
to make amends

40
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,860
for the sake of me.

41
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,180
How to make amends?

42
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,300
Her Majesty has checked

43
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,020
with the Soul-burning Lamp.

44
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,860
Feng Yin's immortal spirit
has been torn apart.

45
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,820
There's no trace of it in the Three Realms.

46
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,500
There will be no day of reunion.

47
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,420
I have a Soul Suppressing Pagoda,

48
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,860
which is an ancient artifact.

49
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,980
Although Immortal Feng's
immortal spirit dispersed,

50
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,300
her physical body remains there.

51
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,020
If her physical body

52
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,620
is contained here,

53
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,660
it will not decay.

54
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,100
In the future, if Immortal Feng's
immortal spirit is returned,

55
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,420
she can be exempted from
thousands of years of cultivation.

56
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,780
I also know
that there is another Soul Suppressing Pagoda

57
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,260
in the Nether Realm.

58
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,180
If the two pagodas summon together,

59
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,220
they may be able

60
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,460
to call back Immortal Feng's
immortal spirit.

61
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,340
Heaven Path.

62
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:56,970
Master.

63
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,500
I can go to the Heaven Path.

64
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,420
As long as Feng Yin can return,

65
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,940
I'll do anything.

66
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,020
The Heaven Path is the path to the gods.

67
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,660
There is the coercion of the gods.

68
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,540
If you ask anything
from the Heaven Stone,

69
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,100
you have to bear nine Heaven Whips.

70
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,380
The Heaven Whips

71
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,980
will all hit on your spirit.

72
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,540
If you're not a demigod,

73
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:14,900
I'm afraid

74
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,180
you will fall.

75
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,140
You can never go

76
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,500
to the Heaven Path.

77
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,340
I'm going to go to the Nether Realm

78
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,980
to beg for
another Soul Suppressing Pagoda.

79
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,940
Please

80
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,540
give me a chance.

81
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,820
If it doesn't work,

82
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,060
go ahead and discipline my disciple.

83
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,260
That being the case,

84
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,180
let Lord Donghua give it a try.

85

98
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,660
(Gu Jin.)

99
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,420
(No.)

100
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,260
(Young Yuan Qi.)

101
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,940
(Are you here to ask)

102
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,740
(for the young Fire Phoenix?)

103
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:04,900
Yes.

104
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,460
Heaven Stone.

105
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,180
I want the return
of Fung Yin's immortal spirit.

106
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,180
(Do you realize)

107
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,580
(that whether
you're a lowly immortal)

108
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,140
(or a true god,)

109
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,220
(it takes a great deal)

110
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,940
(to get to ask anything
from the Heaven Stone?)

111
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,100
Yes.

112
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,140
But if I hadn't happened

113
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,780
to be nearby at that time,

114
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,220
that person wouldn't have been able
to break through

115
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,060
the Heavenly Empress's Sizzling
Fire Barrier anyway.

116
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,500
It was also because of

117
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,700
the blood of chaos in my body

118
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,740
that the Fire Phoenix Jade

119
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,100
given by Mother

120
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,900
recognized me

121
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,020

122

123
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,740
It's all my fault.

130
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,660

Is there a cure

156
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,460
The Heaven Stone was set up

Making a deal with it

158
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,660
is making a promise

159
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,940
How could there be a cure?

160
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,940

spend the rest of his life in fear.

166
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,900
True God Di Juan
has not yet awakened.

Yi He

168
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,540

Are we going

170
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,700
to let the true gods' only bloodline

171
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,180
fall into crisis?

172
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,660

178
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,140
Anyway,

179
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,420
each generation has its own destiny.

Their destiny

181
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,420
is not for us to decide.

182
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,780
Just go with the flow.

183
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,140
Forget it.

184
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:29,580
I have gathered all the immortal spirit
of Chen Fang in these two hundred years.

185
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,180
From tomorrow onwards,

186
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,740
I will be in seclusion,

187
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,540
cultivating the immortal spirit
for Chen Fang.

188
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,100
I have temporarily

189
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:39,140
handed over my position to Lan Feng.

190
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,300
The Three Realms

191
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,100
should be left to the young.

192
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,020
As for the person

193
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,220
Gu Jin said that he didn't know

194
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,940
whether he was a demon or an immortal,

195
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,700
his whereabouts
had not been found so far.

196
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:55,180
I am afraid that the future
of the Three Realms may not be peaceful.

197
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:27,980
(Ten years later)

198
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:30,860
Martial Uncle.

199
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,420
Martial Uncle,
I've brought you some wine.

200
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:42,380
(Forbidden Valley, Daze Mountain)

201
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,060
Martial Uncle.

202
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:47,500
Drunken Jade Dew.

203
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,500
Here comes my Drunken Jade Dew.

204
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,980
Qing Yi, I am coming!

205
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:10,820
(Pass on my order.)

206
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,420
(Gu Jin is so mischievous and misguided)

207
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,980
(that he was grounded in the valley)

208
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,100
(and not allowed to leave.)

209
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,220
Fatty Chi.

210
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,220
You're being way too dutiful.

211
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,000
Her Majesty allowed Qing Yi

212
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,140
to come in for a quarter every month

213
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,300
to bring me food.

214
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,900
It's almost time.

215
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,220
Can't you do me a favor?

216
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,260
(It's still a little short)

217
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,180
(of a month away.)

218
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,540
(Also,)

219
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,300
(please call me Huo Chi. Thank you.)

220
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:36,820
Huo Chi.

221
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,540
I'll roast you

222
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,460
and eat you one day.

223
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,660
- Qing Yi.
- Martial Uncle.

224
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,740
Drunken Jade Dew.

225
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,300
I've waited so hard for you.

226
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:57,780
Thank you, Qing Yi.

227
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,180
Martial Uncle, Master said

228
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,020
that his Drunken Jade Dew
is not as good as Immortal Brew.

229
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,700
But there's only so much
as a bucket a year.

230
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,640
It's full of spiritual power.

231
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:05,700
Take your time.

232
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,540
Drink it sparingly.

233
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,300
Got it.

234
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,660
Am I stuck fishing all the time
again this month?

235
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,580
There's nothing else to do
in the Forbidden Valley.

236
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,140
All right.

237
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:21,780
Come on.

238
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,500
By the way,

239
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,580
any letter for me?

240
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:29,660
Letter?

241
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,300
Letter from Princess Hua Shu!

242
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:40,820
Before I came here,

243
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,460
I wrote a letter to Princess Hua Shu.

244
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,380
I've been here for ten years.

245
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,420
Why hasn't she replied?

246
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,740
Martial Uncle.

247
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,060
You'd better

248
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,660
forget about that letter.

249
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:54,460
Princess Hua Shu
is the top beauty of the Immortal Realm.

250
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,140
The people who want to marry her

251
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,020
could line up from Bainiao Island
to Daze Mountain.

252
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:58,860
What?

253
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,260
She's getting married?

254
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,740
No.

255
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,940
It's good that she's still waiting for me.

256
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:09,540
Her Majesty said that you cannot
leave the Forbidden Valley

257
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,980
until the young Fire Phoenix woke up.

258
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,700
But the young Fire Phoenix

259
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,700
hasn't woken up yet.

260
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,900
When will you be able to leave?

261
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,460
You're all alone here.

262
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,380
I'm really afraid

263
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,620
you'll be mentally ill.

264
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,220
Who can I ask?

265
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:26,020
It doesn't make sense for the Heaven Stone

266
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,460
to go off the rails.

267
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,000
There are just me
and some unintelligent beasts

268
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:33,220
in such a big Forbidden Valley.

269
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,260
I feel like if it goes on,

270
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,700
I'm even going to learn the beast language.

271
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,620
It is almost time.

272
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,980
My Drunken Jade Dew!

273
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,140
Fortunately,

274
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,340
it's not broken.

275
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:10,860
That's good.

276
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:17,620
Qing Yi.

277
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:18,740
Hold this for me.

278
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:32,980
What's this?

279
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,140
This seems to be

280
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,220
an egg of a Water Divine Beast.

281
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,380
Water Divine Beast?

282
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,300
What's that?

283
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,180
Don't you know?

284
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,500
Water Divine Beast

285
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,420
is the entire world's

286
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,580
most nutritious panacea.

287
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,660
Their spiritual core is very nutritious,

288
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,020
and can repair broken internal cores,

289
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,800
and also replenish centuries of immortal power.

290
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,440
Its skin can be used
to treat traumatic injuries,

291
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,000
its bones can be used to treat fire injuries,

292
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,020
and even its nails
can be used as medicine.

293
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,060
It's a pity that the Water Divine Beast Clan

294
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,260
went extinct 70,000 years ago.

295
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,220
I didn't expect to find one

296
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,180
in the Forbidden Valley.

297
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,140
Amazing.

298
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,980
Are you going to eat it, Martial Uncle?

299
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,540
How can I eat it?

300
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,460
How about

301
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,380
giving it to Feng Yin?

302
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,500
Maybe she could wake up earlier.

303
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,540
(Time is up.)

304
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,980
(Get out of here!)

305
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,220
Time is up.

306
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,740
Martial Uncle, I have to go.

307
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,980
I'll come and see you
when your egg hatches.

308
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,540
Let me know

309
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,500
if she replies.

310
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,340
Okay.

311
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,460
How do all those immortal beasts
hatch their eggs?

312
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,020
Is antenatal training needed?

313
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,740
Little guy.

314
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,940
It's my first time hatching an egg

315
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,000
and I don't have much experience.

316
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:00,820
But

317
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,420
your spiritual core is very important to me.

318
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:03,780
On the one hand,

319
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:04,980
you can save Feng Yin.

320
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,420
On the other hand,

321
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,300
my future with Princess Hua Shu

322
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,540
is riding on you.

323
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,300
So you have to work hard.

324
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,340
Hatch yourself out

325
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,740
with me,

326
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:15,820
okay?

327
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,540
But it's getting late.

328
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:19,740
Let's work on it tomorrow.

329
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:29,940
Time to go to bed.

330
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,220
It seems like mothers

331
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,540
like to nest their eggs

332
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,700
in the warmest place possible.

333
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,640
Man.

334
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:07,860
It's been so long.

335
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,860
Why are you

336
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:09,700
still so quiet?

337
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,060
Forget it.

338
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,940
Soak in the bath for a while longer.

339
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,220
The marinated meat Qing Yi made

340
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,580
is quite tasty.

341
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,380
Feng Yin has been sleeping for so long.

342
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,460
Would it be too light

343
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,060
to take a core
as soon as she wakes up?

344
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,540
Marinated egg pickling technique.

345
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:56,620
Anise.

346
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,460
Put some.

347
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,580
Cinnamon, a big one.

348
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,420
Come on.

349
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,380
Bay leaf.

350
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,180
Put some.

351
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,180
Pepper.

352
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,180
Take a dip every day.

353
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,500
By the day you break out of your shell,

354
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,660
I'll have

355
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,020
a spiced core.

356
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,540
(Bad man.)

357
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,340
So that's what you look like.

358
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,020
It's not the same

359
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,060
as in the picture book.

360
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,060
You look

361
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,420
healthier.

362
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,460
Looks like I'm

363
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,180
pretty good at hatching eggs.

364
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,580
Why are you laughing?

365
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,180
You've been running around
since you came out of your shell,

366
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,940
and you went
to the Forbidden Valley.

367
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,780
Listen, the Forbidden Valley

368
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:12,980
is full of fierce

369
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,100
and uncivilized beasts.

370
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,540
If you run off like that,

371
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,700
what if they eat you?

372
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,460
Your core is mine.

373
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,220
If you get eaten by them,
it's going to be wasted.

374
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,060
Understand?

375
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:26,820
Why are you crying?

376
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,980
All right, stop crying.

377
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,980
I was just trying to scare you.

378
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,540
Now that you've transformed,

379
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,580
I don't want to take your internal core.

380
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:41,660
I have a friend.

381
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,060
He is kind of your relative.

382
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,220
How about this?

383
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:46,940
When you grow up,

384
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,340
let's go ask him for advice.

385
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,100
Just use your spiritual power to save people.

386
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,260
Okay?

387
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:57,580
All right.

388
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,300
Come on.

389
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,260
Come on.

390
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,740
I didn't think I'd actually hatch you.

391
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,300
Man.

392
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,940
Why don't you be my spirit beast?

393
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:18,900
Your cries

394
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:19,980
are so unpleasant.

395
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,140
Why don't I call you Yin?

396
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,220
Stay put.

397
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:32,820
Didn't I tell you

398
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:33,660
not to run around?

399
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:37,980
Get down.

400
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,540
Don't you run up there.

401
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:44,580
Don't run around!

402
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,340
It's been six months.

403
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,500
Haven't you tossed enough?

404
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,260
Listen.

405
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,660
From today onwards,

406
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,460
you can't even leave this yard.

407
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:07,740
I'm so exhausted.

408
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,700
Hungry?

409
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:19,900
Say something.

410
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,700
And if I am satisfied,

411
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,540
it is yours.

412
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,020
Whatever.

413
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:32,620
Let me tell you.

414
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,660
If you don't eat, you'll be hungry.

415
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,340
I've had enough.

416
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,420
I'm going to sleep.

417
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,260
Be good.

418
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,940
Stop wasting time.

419
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,660
I've set up a barrier.

420
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,540
You will never get out.

421
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,100
(What is this?)

422
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:47,820
(That bad man)

423
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,140
(seems to like it.)

424
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:52,140
(Then I'll drink it all.)

425
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:26,740
Yin.

426
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,060
Don't do this.

427
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,060
I'll get you some food later.

428
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,020
Yin.

429
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,100
Why is your hair so long?

430
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,620
Who are you?

431
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,460
I'm asking you. Who are you?

432
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:34,980
The bell...

433
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,300
So you are Yin?

434
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:44,540
You've transformed!

435
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:49,860
Transformed?

436
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:56,220
I can even talk.

437
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,420
Why are you...

438
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,820
I am going to eat you.

439
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:13,180
You've just taken form
and you want to eat me?

440
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:14,860
You're so vindictive.

441
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,260
With your immortal power,

442
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,820
you can't defeat me.

443
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:19,460
You!

444
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:26,300
(Yantian Hall)

445
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:26,540
Master.

446
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,940
The Water Divine Beast has been extinct
for tens of thousands of years.

447
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,340
Without the source of its spiritual power,

448
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,660
the nourishment of the Xuan Lake,

449
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,580
it is extremely difficult
for it to survive and hatch,

450
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:34,780
let alone transform

451
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:35,660
in a short period of time.

452
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,460
That's why I felt deeply bad

453
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:38,420
when I heard Qing Yi's report

454
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:39,940
and came to tell you.

455
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,860
Yin, I am back.

456
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,580
Have you worn the new clothes

457
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,420
I sent you?

458
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,180
Why is there a pot?

459
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,580
Are you going to cook for me?

460
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:05,740
Yin!

461
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,020
Yin!

462
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,420
Yin!

463
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,620
Yin, you!

464
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,500
You look good in the new clothes.

465
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:28,180
What are you doing?

466
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,700
Put me down!

467
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,500
You're a newly transformed
immortal beast.

468
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,020
When did you learn
the Immortal-locking Spell?

469
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,300
You want my core?

470
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:38,460
Bad man!

471
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:39,780
Today

472
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,220
I am going to cook you up.

473
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,180
Cook me up?

474
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:43,700
You only remember

475
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,260
that I wanted your core, don't you?

476
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,100
Why don't you remember

477
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,300
how good I was to you?

478
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,020
I took care of you.

479
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,140
I hatched you.

480
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,220
After you took human form,

481
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,660
I gave you new clothes.

482
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,260
Why don't you remember all these?

483
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,340
Just put me down.

484
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,260
Let's talk.

485
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:58,580
No.

486
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,060
Anise.

487
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:04,700
Put some.

488
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,180
Cinnamon.

489
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:08,260
Put some.

490
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,460
Bay leaf.

491
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:10,660
Put some.

492
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,660
Cumin, put some.

493
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:13,820
And tea leaves.

494
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,380
Everything.

495
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:17,620
Okay.

496
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,820
Put me in if you dare.

497
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,500
Come on.

498
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:23,580
Down there.

499
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,100
More fire.

500
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:27,780
Yin.

501
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,140
Put me...

502
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,300
When did you steal my Qiankun Pouch?

503
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,840
Stop it. Inside are some spirit talismans
and immortal artifacts.

504
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,560
If you don't use it properly,
it'll backfire on you.

505
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,100
Yin.

506
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:46,660
Yin.

507
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:48,260
You...

508
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:52,740
What are you doing?

509
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,420
You naughty girl!

510
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,020
You're too young

511
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:07,540
to win me over.

512
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:11,540
Yin.

513
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,380
Don't use these talismans
indiscriminately.

514
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,900
It's a laughing

515
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,820
talisman.

516
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,460
Give it to me.

517
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,260
Yin.

518
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,300
Stop it!

519
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:27,820
Not this one!

520
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:32,420
It is an electric shock talisman.

521
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:36,660
Yin.

522
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:38,740
Come on.

523
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,140
Untie me!

524
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,580
No!

525
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,420
My bottom.

526
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,460
Yin, you!

527
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,700
Have you had enough?

528
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:01,660
You girl!

529
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,460
If I get serious,

530
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,140
you're done.

531
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:11,940
Don't you touch the knife.

532
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,100
The knife...

533
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:21,580
Yin!

534
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,820
You went too far.

535
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,020
Now that you've taken form,

536
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,660
we have to talk about
the laws of the Immortal Realm

537
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:26,660
and the morals of a gentleman.

538
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:27,540
To be honest,

539
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,580
I helped you hatch

540
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,420
from the egg, right?

541
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,460
Now, instead of repaying me

542
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,300
for raising you,

543
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,020
- you want to hurt me?
- Shut up! So noisy.

544
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,180
Let's go to the mountain.

545
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,780
I'll show you something better.

546
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:16,260
Shut up!

547
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,180
This brat

548
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,660
hasn't improved a bit.

549
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:24,140
He's being ruled by an immortal beast.

550
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,140
Xian Shan.

551
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,100
Shanmen Volume.

552
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:39,620
Master.

553
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,420
The bloody light on Jin's roster…

554
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,620
It is an omen
of the looming catastrophe.

555
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,020
He still hasn't dodged

556
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,180
the promise he made to Heaven Stone

557
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,860
to fulfill the catastrophe with himself.

558
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,060
This Water Divine Beast

559
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,780
is precisely his catastrophe.

560
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,220
Even after all the hard work,

561
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,900
he can't escape the God's will.

562
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,540
Gu Jin was formed from the heart blood

563
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:58,260
of True God Di Juan and True Goddess Yi He,

564
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:59,340
inheriting the most ancient

565
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,740
and pure Chaos Bloodline.

566
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,020
How could he be afraid

567
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,860
of a catastrophe brought about
by a Water Divine Beast?

568
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,660
The origin of the Water Divine Beast
is weird.

569
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:07,740
Even I

570
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:10,180
can't figure out her future with Jin.

571
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:11,660
If

572
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:12,940
she brought Jin

573
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,260
a catastrophe of death

574
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,380
and vanishment,

575
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:20,980
even a true god would not be spared.

576
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,380
How dare a worthless

577
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,620
low-level immortal beast

578
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:25,260
(Yantian Hall)
threaten God Yuan Qi?

579
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:26,860
Just kill it.

580
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:33,900
Xian Shan.

581
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:35,860
This is Lord Hong Chou,

582
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:36,940
the chief of Qingchi Palace.

583
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:38,620
She came from the God Realm

584
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,820
and was the one
who watched over God Yuan Qi as he grew up.

585
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:44,180
Greetings to Lord Hong Chou.

586
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:47,700
(Hong Chou, Chief of Qingchi Palace)

587
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:57,940
Donghua, you should know

588
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,220
that I stay in the Immortal Realm

589
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,340
and guard Qingchi Palace

590
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:02,700
only to wait for the day

591
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,220
when God Yuan Qi
returns to the divine throne.

592
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:05,460
I keep the Shanmen Volume

593
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,060
of Daze Mountain in my palm,

594
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:08,060
and I am always concerned

595
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,420
about God Yuan Qi's safety,

596
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,340
just because

597
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,380
I don't trust you.

598
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,340
Lord Hong Chou

599
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,340
is still so relentless.

600
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:18,000
It was because
you didn't stop God Yuan Qi in time

601
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,860
that he responded
to the catastrophe with himself

602
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,580
in exchange for the life of the Fire Phoenix.

603
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,100
If it was me back then,

604
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,660
I would rather go on the Heaven Path myself

605
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:25,620
than let God Yuan Qi

606
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:26,940
be damaged in the slightest.

607
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:30,020
Even though the Fire Phoenix lineage
is precious,

608
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:31,420
how can it compare

609
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,780
to the safety of God Yuan Qi?

610
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,300
Now the catastrophe is imminent,

611
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:36,940
why don't you

612
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:37,900
catch and dispose of

613
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,100
this low-ranking immortal beast
as soon as possible?

614
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:40,420
No way.

615
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:42,820
Immortal beasts are also living beings
in the Three Realms,

616
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,420
how can they be killed at will?

617
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,540
True Goddess Yi He
has long since issued an edict

618
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,060
that the order of the Three Realms

619
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,340
cannot be disrupted for God Yuan Qi.

620
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,180
This is against the laws of heaven,

621
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,380
and it will also jeopardize

622
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,020
God Yuan Qi's own destiny.

623
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,300
I can try

624
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:57,100
to avoid this catastrophe.

625
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,300
Okay.

626
00:35:58,900 --> 00:35:59,780
Then take a try.

627
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,900
If your method fails,

628
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:03,820
I'll use mine

629
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,220
to dispose of the beast.

630
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:12,460
What do you want?

631
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,540
- Go.
- Why should I listen to you?

632
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,420
I'm not going anywhere.

633
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:15,540
Why don't you go?

634
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:17,260
Why should I listen to you?

635
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,300
What's this?

636
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:22,460
Four Perils, maybe.

637
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,420
Look what trouble you made.

638
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:39,580
Happy now?

639
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:43,660
Smart.

640
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,540
Fire talismans

641
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,780
are Four Perils' favorite.

642
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,300
What should I say about you?

643
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,260
Now is better.

644
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:00,500
But the talisman

645
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,980
probably won't last long.

646
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,820
What to do then?

647
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:11,660
But I...

648
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:23,940
Qiankun Pouch.

649
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:32,500
Cool?

650
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:37,980
Run!

651
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,500
Hurry up!

652
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,220
This way.

653
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,660
No. No.

654
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:20,540
Here.

655
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:21,980
No, this way.

656
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:22,820
This way.

657
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:25,220
Go.

658
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:36,740
Watch out!

659
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:51,460
Go.

660
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,100
Master, it is done.

661
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,460
I have bonded the two of them

662
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:53,900
with master-servant contract.

663
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:56,340
Water Divine Beast Yin

664
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:58,180
has become God Yuan Qi's
immortal servant.

665
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,980
The contract can be used
to resolve any grievances,

666
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,100
whether they be those of murder,

667
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,100
love, or grudge.

668
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:05,400
As long as the master-servant contract
remains intact,

669
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,340
God Yuan Qi will be safe?

670
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,180
That's right.

671
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,420
Master is at the peak of demigod,

672
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:11,420
almost becoming God Jin.

673
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,140
There are very few people
in the Three Realms

674
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:15,140
who can break
his master-servant contract.

675
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,140
Lord.

676
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:17,380
Don't worry.

677
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:20,380
Then let's keep this beast alive
for now.

678
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,780
I'll keep an eye

679
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:24,180
on God Yuan Qi's safety.

680
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:27,820
If this Water Divine Beast
dares to hurt him again,

681
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:30,460
I will no longer be polite to her.

682
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,300
- What did you just do to me?
- What did you just do to me?

683
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,160
- Why are you talking like me?
- Why are you talking like me?

684
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,660
- You're the one talking like me!
- You're the one talking like me!

685
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,660
Is it a trick?

686
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,580
Martial Uncle.

687
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:00,620
Qing Yi.

688
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,860
Why are you here?

689
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,540
Master asked me to come here to find you.

690
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:06,900
This is Yin?

691
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:11,460
She's being disciplined
by the master-servant contract.

692
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:13,020
Master-servant contract?

693
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:14,500
What is it?

694
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,620
Master has bonded you and Yin

695
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:16,700
with the master-servant contract.

696
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,180
She cannot think ill of you,

697
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,100
have delusional thoughts,

698
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,220
hurt you,

699
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:21,340
- or...
- Wait.

700
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,980
You mean

701
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,500
she'll never hurt me again?

702
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:29,860
Who gave you permission

703
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:31,320
to bind me
with the master-servant contract?

704
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,620
Or she'll be disciplined

705
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:37,740
like this.

706
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,220
Like this.

707
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:48,740
What is going on?

708
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,500
It's the same thing
with the master-servant contract.

709
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:51,700
She's restricted

710
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:52,980
to your immediate vicinity

711
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,580
and must do as she's told.

712
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:55,660
At my command?

713
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:05,100
Interesting.

714
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:06,980
Thank you, Master,

715
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:08,860
for saving me from suffering.

716
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:56,900
What's the noise?

717
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:05,660
You're still holding a knife.

718
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:07,980
You've been up all night.

719
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:09,180
So stubborn.

720
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:12,980
(My disciple.)

721
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:14,380
(It's time to come out.)

722
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:16,420
Master?

723
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:24,900
Get up.

724
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:26,260
Let's go.

725
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:40,440
The prohibition of the Forbidden Valley
has been lifted.

726
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:43,620
Could it be that the young Fire Phoenix
has returned?

727
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:48,460
Good luck for you.

728
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:49,500
You've just taken form

729
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:50,420
and you can go out.

730
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:52,500
Be obedient after getting out.

731
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:53,340
Understand?

732
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:57,420
