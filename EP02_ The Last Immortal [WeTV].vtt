00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.630
Your Majesty.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.300
Please show some mercy.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.180
Your Majesty.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.020
All elders.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.620
I foresaw

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:55.820
that my disciple was naughty

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:56.900
and had gotten into trouble.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:57.980
That's why I'm here.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.340
I'd like to ask all of you

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.940
to give him a chance

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.140
to make amends

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.860
for the sake of me.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.180
How to make amends?

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.300
Her Majesty has checked

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.020
with the Soul-burning Lamp.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.860
Feng Yin's immortal spirit
has been torn apart.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.820
There's no trace of it in the Three Realms.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.500
There will be no day of reunion.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.420
I have a Soul Suppressing Pagoda,

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.860
which is an ancient artifact.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.980
Although Immortal Feng's
immortal spirit dispersed,

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.300
her physical body remains there.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.020
If her physical body

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.620
is contained here,

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:35.660
it will not decay.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.100
In the future, if Immortal Feng's
immortal spirit is returned,

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.420
she can be exempted from
thousands of years of cultivation.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.780
I also know
that there is another Soul Suppressing Pagoda

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.260
in the Nether Realm.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.180
If the two pagodas summon together,

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.220
they may be able

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.460
to call back Immortal Feng's
immortal spirit.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.340
Heaven Path.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.970
Master.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.500
I can go to the Heaven Path.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.420
As long as Feng Yin can return,

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.940
I'll do anything.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.020
The Heaven Path is the path to the gods.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.660
There is the coercion of the gods.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.540
If you ask anything
from the Heaven Stone,

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.100
you have to bear nine Heaven Whips.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:10.380
The Heaven Whips

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.980
will all hit on your spirit.

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.540
If you're not a demigod,

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.900
I'm afraid

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.180
you will fall.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.140
You can never go

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.500
to the Heaven Path.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.340
I'm going to go to the Nether Realm

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.980
to beg for
another Soul Suppressing Pagoda.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:23.940
Please

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.540
give me a chance.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:26.820
If it doesn't work,

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.060
go ahead and discipline my disciple.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.260
That being the case,

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.180
let Lord Donghua give it a try.

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.260

What the wise man sees,

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:52.900
break through the nameless.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:55.660
(Gu Jin.)

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:57.420
(No.)

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.260
(Young Yuan Qi.)

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:01.940
(Are you here to ask)

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.740
(for the young Fire Phoenix?)

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.900
Yes.

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:06.460
Heaven Stone.

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.180
I want the return
of Fung Yin's immortal spirit.

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.180
(Do you realize)

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.580
(that whether
you're a lowly immortal)

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.140
(or a true god,)

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.220
(it takes a great deal)

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.940
(to get to ask anything
from the Heaven Stone?)

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.100
Yes.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.140
But if I hadn't happened

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.780
to be nearby at that time,

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.220
that person wouldn't have been able
to break through

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.060
the Heavenly Empress's Sizzling
Fire Barrier anyway.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.500
It was also because of

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.700
the blood of chaos in my body

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:38.740
that the Fire Phoenix Jade

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:40.100
given by Mother

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:41.900
recognized me

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.020
and sucked up all the immortal spirit

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.180
of the young Fire Phoenix.

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.740
It's all my fault.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:49.740
(A Fire Phoenix)

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.660

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.500
(Feng Yin was born in defiance of nature.)

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.180
(So her return)

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.180
(is even more unnatural.)

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.580
(It's not too late for you to regret now.)

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:03.660
I won't regret it.

(I didn't realize)

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:16.860
(that Feng Yin's return)

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:18.500
(was going)

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:19.980
(to cost Gu Jin so much.)

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:24.660
Is there a cure
for the curse of the Heaven Stone?

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:27.460
The Heaven Stone was set up
by the Ancestral God Qing Tian.

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.660
Making a deal with it

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:31.660
is making a promise
to the Ancestral God.

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:32.940
How could there be a cure?

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.940
Even if Gu Jin hides in the God Realm,

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:38.180
he can't avoid it.

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:40.100
You don't know
when this catastrophe will come

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:42.060
and in what form.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:43.660
I'm afraid he'll have to

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.020
spend the rest of his life in fear.

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.900
True God Di Juan
has not yet awakened.

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:54.020
Yi He

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:56.540
entrusted this child to us back then.

00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:58.220
Are we going

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:01.700
to let the true gods' only bloodline

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:03.180
fall into crisis?

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:05.660
I predicted

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:06.900
Gu Jin's destiny last night.

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:08.460
His Catastrophe-relief Gate

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:09.860
lies in the return of Feng Yin.

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:11.500
The karma entwined between them

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:12.980
is by no means so simple.

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:15.140
Anyway,

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:17.420
each generation has its own destiny.

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:18.740
Their destiny

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:20.420
is not for us to decide.

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:22.780
Just go with the flow.

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:24.140
Forget it.

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:29.580
I have gathered all the immortal spirit
of Chen Fang in these two hundred years.

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:31.180
From tomorrow onwards,

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:32.740
I will be in seclusion,

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:34.540
cultivating the immortal spirit
for Chen Fang.

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:36.100
I have temporarily

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:39.140
handed over my position to Lan Feng.

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:41.300
The Three Realms

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:44.100
should be left to the young.

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:46.020
As for the person

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:47.220
Gu Jin said that he didn't know

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:48.940
whether he was a demon or an immortal,

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:50.700
his whereabouts
had not been found so far.

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:55.180
I am afraid that the future
of the Three Realms may not be peaceful.

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:27.980
(Ten years later)

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:30.860
Martial Uncle.

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:36.420
Martial Uncle,
I've brought you some wine.

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:42.380
(Forbidden Valley, Daze Mountain)

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:45.060
Martial Uncle.

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:47.500
Drunken Jade Dew.

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:49.500
Here comes my Drunken Jade Dew.

00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:58.980
Qing Yi, I am coming!

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:10.820
(Pass on my order.)

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:12.420
(Gu Jin is so mischievous and misguided)

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:13.980
(that he was grounded in the valley)

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:15.100
(and not allowed to leave.)

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:18.220
Fatty Chi.

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:20.220
You're being way too dutiful.

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:22.000
Her Majesty allowed Qing Yi

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.140
to come in for a quarter every month

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:24.300
to bring me food.

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:26.900
It's almost time.

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:28.220
Can't you do me a favor?

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:30.260
(It's still a little short)

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:31.180
(of a month away.)

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:32.540
(Also,)

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:35.300
(please call me Huo Chi. Thank you.)

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:36.820
Huo Chi.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:38.540
I'll roast you

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:39.460
and eat you one day.

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:48.660
- Qing Yi.
- Martial Uncle.

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:51.740
Drunken Jade Dew.

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:54.300
I've waited so hard for you.

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:57.780
Thank you, Qing Yi.

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:00.180
Martial Uncle, Master said

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:02.020
that his Drunken Jade Dew
is not as good as Immortal Brew.

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:03.700
But there's only so much
as a bucket a year.

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:04.640
It's full of spiritual power.

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:05.700
Take your time.

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:07.540
Drink it sparingly.

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:09.300
Got it.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.660
Am I stuck fishing all the time
again this month?

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:16.580
There's nothing else to do
in the Forbidden Valley.

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:20.140
All right.

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:21.780
Come on.

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:25.500
By the way,

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:27.580
any letter for me?

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:29.660
Letter?

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:32.300
Letter from Princess Hua Shu!

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:40.820
Before I came here,

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:42.460
I wrote a letter to Princess Hua Shu.

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:44.380
I've been here for ten years.

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:46.420
Why hasn't she replied?

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:48.740
Martial Uncle.

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:50.060
You'd better

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:51.660
forget about that letter.

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:54.460
Princess Hua Shu
is the top beauty of the Immortal Realm.

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:56.140
The people who want to marry her

00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:58.020
could line up from Bainiao Island
to Daze Mountain.

00:11:58.020 --> 00:11:58.860
What?

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:00.260
She's getting married?

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:01.740
No.

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:05.940
It's good that she's still waiting for me.

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:09.540
Her Majesty said that you cannot
leave the Forbidden Valley

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:10.980
until the young Fire Phoenix woke up.

00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:12.700
But the young Fire Phoenix

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:13.700
hasn't woken up yet.

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:15.900
When will you be able to leave?

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:18.460
You're all alone here.

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:19.380
I'm really afraid

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:20.620
you'll be mentally ill.

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:23.220
Who can I ask?

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:26.020
It doesn't make sense for the Heaven Stone

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:27.460
to go off the rails.

00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:31.000
There are just me
and some unintelligent beasts

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:33.220
in such a big Forbidden Valley.

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:35.260
I feel like if it goes on,

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:37.700
I'm even going to learn the beast language.

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:41.620
It is almost time.

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:50.980
My Drunken Jade Dew!

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:08.140
Fortunately,

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:09.340
it's not broken.

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:10.860
That's good.

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:17.620
Qing Yi.

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:18.740
Hold this for me.

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:32.980
What's this?

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:35.140
This seems to be

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:38.220
an egg of a Water Divine Beast.

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:39.380
Water Divine Beast?

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:41.300
What's that?

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:43.180
Don't you know?

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:45.500
Water Divine Beast

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:46.420
is the entire world's

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:47.580
most nutritious panacea.

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:49.660
Their spiritual core is very nutritious,

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:51.020
and can repair broken internal cores,

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:52.800
and also replenish centuries of immortal power.

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:54.440
Its skin can be used
to treat traumatic injuries,

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.000
its bones can be used to treat fire injuries,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.020
and even its nails
can be used as medicine.

00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:00.060
It's a pity that the Water Divine Beast Clan

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:01.260
went extinct 70,000 years ago.

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:03.220
I didn't expect to find one

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:04.180
in the Forbidden Valley.

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:06.140
Amazing.

00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:07.980
Are you going to eat it, Martial Uncle?

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:10.540
How can I eat it?

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:13.460
How about

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:16.380
giving it to Feng Yin?

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:18.500
Maybe she could wake up earlier.

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:20.540
(Time is up.)

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:21.980
(Get out of here!)

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:23.220
Time is up.

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:24.740
Martial Uncle, I have to go.

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:26.980
I'll come and see you
when your egg hatches.

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:30.540
Let me know

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:31.500
if she replies.

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:32.340
Okay.

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:47.460
How do all those immortal beasts
hatch their eggs?

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:49.020
Is antenatal training needed?

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:55.740
Little guy.

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:57.940
It's my first time hatching an egg

00:14:57.940 --> 00:14:59.000
and I don't have much experience.

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:00.820
But

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:02.420
your spiritual core is very important to me.

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:03.780
On the one hand,

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:04.980
you can save Feng Yin.

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:06.420
On the other hand,

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:09.300
my future with Princess Hua Shu

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:10.540
is riding on you.

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:12.300
So you have to work hard.

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:13.340
Hatch yourself out

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:14.740
with me,

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:15.820
okay?

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:18.540
But it's getting late.

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:19.740
Let's work on it tomorrow.

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:29.940
Time to go to bed.

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:46.220
It seems like mothers

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:47.540
like to nest their eggs

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:48.700
in the warmest place possible.

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:06.640
Man.

00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:07.860
It's been so long.

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:08.860
Why are you

00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:09.700
still so quiet?

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:14.060
Forget it.

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:15.940
Soak in the bath for a while longer.

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:29.220
The marinated meat Qing Yi made

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:30.580
is quite tasty.

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:40.380
Feng Yin has been sleeping for so long.

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:44.460
Would it be too light

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:46.060
to take a core
as soon as she wakes up?

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:55.540
Marinated egg pickling technique.

00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:56.620
Anise.

00:17:58.620 --> 00:17:59.460
Put some.

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:02.580
Cinnamon, a big one.

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:04.420
Come on.

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:05.380
Bay leaf.

00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:07.180
Put some.

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:08.180
Pepper.

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:16.180
Take a dip every day.

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:18.500
By the day you break out of your shell,

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:19.660
I'll have

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:21.020
a spiced core.

00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:01.540
(Bad man.)

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:48.340
So that's what you look like.

00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:50.020
It's not the same

00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:51.060
as in the picture book.

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:53.060
You look

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:56.420
healthier.

00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:58.460
Looks like I'm

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:00.180
pretty good at hatching eggs.

00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:05.580
Why are you laughing?

00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:08.180
You've been running around
since you came out of your shell,

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:09.940
and you went
to the Forbidden Valley.

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:11.780
Listen, the Forbidden Valley

00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:12.980
is full of fierce

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:14.100
and uncivilized beasts.

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:15.540
If you run off like that,

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:16.700
what if they eat you?

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:19.460
Your core is mine.

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:21.220
If you get eaten by them,
it's going to be wasted.

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:22.060
Understand?

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:26.820
Why are you crying?

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:31.980
All right, stop crying.

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:34.980
I was just trying to scare you.

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:36.540
Now that you've transformed,

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:38.580
I don't want to take your internal core.

00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:41.660
I have a friend.

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:44.060
He is kind of your relative.

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:45.220
How about this?

00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:46.940
When you grow up,

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:48.340
let's go ask him for advice.

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:50.100
Just use your spiritual power to save people.

00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:51.260
Okay?

00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:57.580
All right.

00:21:58.460 --> 00:21:59.300
Come on.

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:02.260
Come on.

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:10.740
I didn't think I'd actually hatch you.

00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:14.300
Man.

00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:15.940
Why don't you be my spirit beast?

00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:18.900
Your cries

00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:19.980
are so unpleasant.

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:23.140
Why don't I call you Yin?

00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:30.220
Stay put.

00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:32.820
Didn't I tell you

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:33.660
not to run around?

00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:37.980
Get down.

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:40.540
Don't you run up there.

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:44.580
Don't run around!

00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:54.340
It's been six months.

00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:55.500
Haven't you tossed enough?

00:22:57.420 --> 00:22:58.260
Listen.

00:22:58.540 --> 00:22:59.660
From today onwards,

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:03.460
you can't even leave this yard.

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:07.740
I'm so exhausted.

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:16.700
Hungry?

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:19.900
Say something.

00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:21.700
And if I am satisfied,

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:22.540
it is yours.

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:31.020
Whatever.

00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:32.620
Let me tell you.

00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:34.660
If you don't eat, you'll be hungry.

00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:43.340
I've had enough.

00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:45.420
I'm going to sleep.

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:46.260
Be good.

00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:30.940
Stop wasting time.

00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:32.660
I've set up a barrier.

00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:35.540
You will never get out.

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:40.100
(What is this?)

00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:47.820
(That bad man)

00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:49.140
(seems to like it.)

00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:52.140
(Then I'll drink it all.)

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:26.740
Yin.

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:30.060
Don't do this.

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:33.060
I'll get you some food later.

00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:52.020
Yin.

00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:55.100
Why is your hair so long?

00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:13.620
Who are you?

00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:19.460
I'm asking you. Who are you?

00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:34.980
The bell...

00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:42.300
So you are Yin?

00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:44.540
You've transformed!

00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:49.860
Transformed?

00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:56.220
I can even talk.

00:27:58.580 --> 00:27:59.420
Why are you...

00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:04.820
I am going to eat you.

00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:13.180
You've just taken form
and you want to eat me?

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:14.860
You're so vindictive.

00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:16.260
With your immortal power,

00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:17.820
you can't defeat me.

00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:19.460
You!

00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:26.300
(Yantian Hall)

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:26.540
Master.

00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:28.940
The Water Divine Beast has been extinct
for tens of thousands of years.

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:30.340
Without the source of its spiritual power,

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:31.660
the nourishment of the Xuan Lake,

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:33.580
it is extremely difficult
for it to survive and hatch,

00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:34.780
let alone transform

00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:35.660
in a short period of time.

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:37.460
That's why I felt deeply bad

00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:38.420
when I heard Qing Yi's report

00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:39.940
and came to tell you.

00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:44.860
Yin, I am back.

00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:48.580
Have you worn the new clothes

00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:49.420
I sent you?

00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:58.180
Why is there a pot?

00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:01.580
Are you going to cook for me?

00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:05.740
Yin!

00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:07.020
Yin!

00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:08.420
Yin!

00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:20.620
Yin, you!

00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:23.500
You look good in the new clothes.

00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:28.180
What are you doing?

00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:29.700
Put me down!

00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:31.500
You're a newly transformed
immortal beast.

00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:33.020
When did you learn
the Immortal-locking Spell?

00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:35.300
You want my core?

00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:38.460
Bad man!

00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:39.780
Today

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:41.220
I am going to cook you up.

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:42.180
Cook me up?

00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:43.700
You only remember

00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:45.260
that I wanted your core, don't you?

00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:46.100
Why don't you remember

00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:47.300
how good I was to you?

00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:49.020
I took care of you.

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:50.140
I hatched you.

00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:51.220
After you took human form,

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:52.660
I gave you new clothes.

00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:54.260
Why don't you remember all these?

00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:56.340
Just put me down.

00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:57.260
Let's talk.

00:29:57.740 --> 00:29:58.580
No.

00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:03.060
Anise.

00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:04.700
Put some.

00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:07.180
Cinnamon.

00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:08.260
Put some.

00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:09.460
Bay leaf.

00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:10.660
Put some.

00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:12.660
Cumin, put some.

00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:13.820
And tea leaves.

00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:15.380
Everything.

00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:17.620
Okay.

00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:19.820
Put me in if you dare.

00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:22.500
Come on.

00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:23.580
Down there.

00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:25.100
More fire.

00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:27.780
Yin.

00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:35.140
Put me...

00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:39.300
When did you steal my Qiankun Pouch?

00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:41.840
Stop it. Inside are some spirit talismans
and immortal artifacts.

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:43.560
If you don't use it properly,
it'll backfire on you.

00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:44.100
Yin.

00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:46.660
Yin.

00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:48.260
You...

00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:52.740
What are you doing?

00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:04.420
You naughty girl!

00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:06.020
You're too young

00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:07.540
to win me over.

00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:11.540
Yin.

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:13.380
Don't use these talismans
indiscriminately.

00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:14.900
It's a laughing

00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:18.820
talisman.

00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:20.460
Give it to me.

00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:22.260
Yin.

00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:24.300
Stop it!

00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:27.820
Not this one!

00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:32.420
It is an electric shock talisman.

00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:36.660
Yin.

00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:38.740
Come on.

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:43.140
Untie me!

00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:44.580
No!

00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:54.420
My bottom.

00:31:57.380 --> 00:31:58.460
Yin, you!

00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:00.700
Have you had enough?

00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:01.660
You girl!

00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:08.460
If I get serious,

00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:10.140
you're done.

00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:11.940
Don't you touch the knife.

00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:15.100
The knife...

00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:21.580
Yin!

00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:22.820
You went too far.

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:24.020
Now that you've taken form,

00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:25.660
we have to talk about
the laws of the Immortal Realm

00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:26.660
and the morals of a gentleman.

00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:27.540
To be honest,

00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:29.580
I helped you hatch

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:30.420
from the egg, right?

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:31.460
Now, instead of repaying me

00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:32.300
for raising you,

00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:34.020
- you want to hurt me?
- Shut up! So noisy.

00:32:57.260 --> 00:32:58.180
Let's go to the mountain.

00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:00.780
I'll show you something better.

00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:16.260
Shut up!

00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:20.180
This brat

00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:21.660
hasn't improved a bit.

00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:24.140
He's being ruled by an immortal beast.

00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:26.140
Xian Shan.

00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:27.100
Shanmen Volume.

00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:39.620
Master.

00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:41.420
The bloody light on Jin's roster…

00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:43.620
It is an omen
of the looming catastrophe.

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:45.020
He still hasn't dodged

00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:46.180
the promise he made to Heaven Stone

00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:47.860
to fulfill the catastrophe with himself.

00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:49.060
This Water Divine Beast

00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:50.780
is precisely his catastrophe.

00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:53.220
Even after all the hard work,

00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:54.900
he can't escape the God's will.

00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:56.540
Gu Jin was formed from the heart blood

00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:58.260
of True God Di Juan and True Goddess Yi He,

00:33:58.260 --> 00:33:59.340
inheriting the most ancient

00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:00.740
and pure Chaos Bloodline.

00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:02.020
How could he be afraid

00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:03.860
of a catastrophe brought about
by a Water Divine Beast?

00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:06.660
The origin of the Water Divine Beast
is weird.

00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:07.740
Even I

00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:10.180
can't figure out her future with Jin.

00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:11.660
If

00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:12.940
she brought Jin

00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:14.260
a catastrophe of death

00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:16.380
and vanishment,

00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:20.980
even a true god would not be spared.

00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:22.380
How dare a worthless

00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:23.620
low-level immortal beast

00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:25.260
(Yantian Hall)
threaten God Yuan Qi?

00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:26.860
Just kill it.

00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:33.900
Xian Shan.

00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:35.860
This is Lord Hong Chou,

00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:36.940
the chief of Qingchi Palace.

00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:38.620
She came from the God Realm

00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:40.820
and was the one
who watched over God Yuan Qi as he grew up.

00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:44.180
Greetings to Lord Hong Chou.

00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:47.700
(Hong Chou, Chief of Qingchi Palace)

00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:57.940
Donghua, you should know

00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:00.220
that I stay in the Immortal Realm

00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:01.340
and guard Qingchi Palace

00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:02.700
only to wait for the day

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:04.220
when God Yuan Qi
returns to the divine throne.

00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:05.460
I keep the Shanmen Volume

00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:07.060
of Daze Mountain in my palm,

00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:08.060
and I am always concerned

00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:09.420
about God Yuan Qi's safety,

00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:10.340
just because

00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:12.380
I don't trust you.

00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:14.340
Lord Hong Chou

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:16.340
is still so relentless.

00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:18.000
It was because
you didn't stop God Yuan Qi in time

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.860
that he responded
to the catastrophe with himself

00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:21.580
in exchange for the life of the Fire Phoenix.

00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:23.100
If it was me back then,

00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:24.660
I would rather go on the Heaven Path myself

00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:25.620
than let God Yuan Qi

00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:26.940
be damaged in the slightest.

00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:30.020
Even though the Fire Phoenix lineage
is precious,

00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:31.420
how can it compare

00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:32.780
to the safety of God Yuan Qi?

00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:35.300
Now the catastrophe is imminent,

00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:36.940
why don't you

00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:37.900
catch and dispose of

00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:40.100
this low-ranking immortal beast
as soon as possible?

00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:40.420
No way.

00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:42.820
Immortal beasts are also living beings
in the Three Realms,

00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:44.420
how can they be killed at will?

00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:46.540
True Goddess Yi He
has long since issued an edict

00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:48.060
that the order of the Three Realms

00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:49.340
cannot be disrupted for God Yuan Qi.

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:51.180
This is against the laws of heaven,

00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:52.380
and it will also jeopardize

00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:54.020
God Yuan Qi's own destiny.

00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:55.300
I can try

00:35:55.540 --> 00:35:57.100
to avoid this catastrophe.

00:35:57.460 --> 00:35:58.300
Okay.

00:35:58.900 --> 00:35:59.780
Then take a try.

00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:01.900
If your method fails,

00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:03.820
I'll use mine

00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:05.220
to dispose of the beast.

00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:12.460
What do you want?

00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:13.540
- Go.
- Why should I listen to you?

00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:14.420
I'm not going anywhere.

00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:15.540
Why don't you go?

00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:17.260
Why should I listen to you?

00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:21.300
What's this?

00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:22.460
Four Perils, maybe.

00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:37.420
Look what trouble you made.

00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:39.580
Happy now?

00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:43.660
Smart.

00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:45.540
Fire talismans

00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:46.780
are Four Perils' favorite.

00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:49.300
What should I say about you?

00:36:57.900 --> 00:36:59.260
Now is better.

00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:00.500
But the talisman

00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:01.980
probably won't last long.

00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:08.820
What to do then?

00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:11.660
But I...

00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:23.940
Qiankun Pouch.

00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:32.500
Cool?

00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:37.980
Run!

00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:07.500
Hurry up!

00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:17.220
This way.

00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:19.660
No. No.

00:38:19.690 --> 00:38:20.540
Here.

00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:21.980
No, this way.

00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:22.820
This way.

00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:25.220
Go.

00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:36.740
Watch out!

00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:51.460
Go.

00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:50.100
Master, it is done.

00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:52.460
I have bonded the two of them

00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:53.900
with master-servant contract.

00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:56.340
Water Divine Beast Yin

00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:58.180
has become God Yuan Qi's
immortal servant.

00:39:58.280 --> 00:39:59.980
The contract can be used
to resolve any grievances,

00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:01.100
whether they be those of murder,

00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:03.100
love, or grudge.

00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:05.400
As long as the master-servant contract
remains intact,

00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:07.340
God Yuan Qi will be safe?

00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:08.180
That's right.

00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:10.420
Master is at the peak of demigod,

00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:11.420
almost becoming God Jin.

00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:13.140
There are very few people
in the Three Realms

00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:15.140
who can break
his master-servant contract.

00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:16.140
Lord.

00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:17.380
Don't worry.

00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:20.380
Then let's keep this beast alive
for now.

00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:22.780
I'll keep an eye

00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:24.180
on God Yuan Qi's safety.

00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:27.820
If this Water Divine Beast
dares to hurt him again,

00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:30.460
I will no longer be polite to her.

00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:43.300
- What did you just do to me?
- What did you just do to me?

00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:45.160
- Why are you talking like me?
- Why are you talking like me?

00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:47.660
- You're the one talking like me!
- You're the one talking like me!

00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:56.660
Is it a trick?

00:40:57.580 --> 00:40:58.580
Martial Uncle.

00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:00.620
Qing Yi.

00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:02.860
Why are you here?

00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:04.540
Master asked me to come here to find you.

00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:06.900
This is Yin?

00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:11.460
She's being disciplined
by the master-servant contract.

00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:13.020
Master-servant contract?

00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:14.500
What is it?

00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:15.620
Master has bonded you and Yin

00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:16.700
with the master-servant contract.

00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:18.180
She cannot think ill of you,

00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:19.100
have delusional thoughts,

00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:20.220
hurt you,

00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:21.340
- or...
- Wait.

00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:24.980
You mean

00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:27.500
she'll never hurt me again?

00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:29.860
Who gave you permission

00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:31.320
to bind me
with the master-servant contract?

00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:36.620
Or she'll be disciplined

00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:37.740
like this.

00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:39.220
Like this.

00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:48.740
What is going on?

00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:50.500
It's the same thing
with the master-servant contract.

00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:51.700
She's restricted

00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:52.980
to your immediate vicinity

00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:54.580
and must do as she's told.

00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:55.660
At my command?

00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:05.100
Interesting.

00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:06.980
Thank you, Master,

00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:08.860
for saving me from suffering.

00:42:55.780 --> 00:42:56.900
What's the noise?

00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:05.660
You're still holding a knife.

00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:07.980
You've been up all night.

00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:09.180
So stubborn.

00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:12.980
(My disciple.)

00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:14.380
(It's time to come out.)

00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:16.420
Master?

00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:24.900
Get up.

00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:26.260
Let's go.

00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:40.440
The prohibition of the Forbidden Valley
has been lifted.

00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:43.620
Could it be that the young Fire Phoenix
has returned?

00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:48.460
Good luck for you.

00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:49.500
You've just taken form

00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:50.420
and you can go out.

00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:52.500
Be obedient after getting out.

00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:53.340
Understand?

00:43:56.380 --> 00:43:57.420
Understand?
