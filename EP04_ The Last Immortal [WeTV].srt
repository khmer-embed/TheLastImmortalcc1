29
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:41,620
(Yantian Hall)

30
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,190
Lord Donghua ascended to the God Realm.

31
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,760
I'm here to congratulate him

32
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,830
on behalf of the Bainiao Island.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,840
Your Highness,

34
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,850
thank you for coming.

35
00:01:58,850 --> 00:01:59,840
My father should've come here

36
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,190
to congratulate him in person,

37
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,640
but he went to the battle

38
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,300
a while ago to defend the Bainiao Island,

39
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,500
and he hasn't recovered from his injury,

40
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,430
so he sent me.

41
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,580
May I

42
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,510
meet with Lord Donghua?

43
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:11,680
My Master has just ascended

44
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,520
to the God Realm.

45
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,870
He asked the two of us

46
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:14,940
to say goodbye

47
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,230
to everyone on his behalf.

48
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,340
Actually,

49
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,020
there's something else

50
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,510
that brought me here today.

51
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,140
I wonder if I can

52
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,190
borrow Lord Donghua's

53
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,300
Sky-shrouding Umbrella

54
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:27,510
to fend off the invasion of the Eagle Clan.

55
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,030
Hongque.

56
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,740
This is Peacock Feather Crown,

57
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,780
a holy treasure of our Peacock Clan.

58
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,390
We'd like to give it to Daze Mountain

59
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:44,020
in exchange of borrowing
the Umbrella for one year.

60
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:45,510
Your Highness,

61
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,430
I'm afraid we can't lend it to you.

62
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,740
Before my Master left,

63
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:50,620
he already gave the Umbrella

64
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,990
to Gu Jin.

65
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,870
The Umbrella is now Gu Jin's

66
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:54,950
personal weapon.

67
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,510
We can't speak for him.

68
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,390
Please try to understand, Your Highness.

69
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,840
Gu Jin.

70
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,360
Yin.

71
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,620
Yin.

72
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,780
Thanks to my hard training,

73
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,020
my spiritual power improved again.

74
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,590
I can finally stay further

75
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,460
from that fool.

76
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,430
Can I take another step forward?

77
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,550
Where is she?

78
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,470
She's supposed to prepare
for going down the mountain tomorrow.

79
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,510
Where did she go?

80
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,510
So troublesome.

81
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:14,990
Yin.

82
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,830
Your Highness, why do you have
to go visit him in person?

83
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,910
You could just wait in the hall

84
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,190
and send a message,

85
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,820
and that Immortal Gu Jin

86
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,190
will come to visit you for sure.

87
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,040
With Lord Donghua ascending to the God Realm,

88
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,020
Senior Immortal Xian Shan
is now in charge of Daze Mountain.

89
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,550
And Gu Jin is the Chief Elder

90
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:32,390
of Daze Mountain.

91
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,660
There's nothing improper for me to visit him.

92
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,220
Immortal Gu Jin.

93
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:54,980
Are you Immortal Gu Jin?

94
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:58,900
Your Highness.

95
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,950
(Inaction)
Your Highness, long time no see.

96
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,420
You are really Immortal Gu Jin.

97
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,750
I'm here to pay you a visit.

98
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,070
Pay me a visit?

99
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,020
After we parted from Wutong Island,

100
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:19,300
I was going to come
to Daze Mountain to see you.

101
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,310
Unfortunately, our Peacock Clan
has been battling

102
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,660
against the Eagle Clan these years.

103
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,830
I had to stay with my father and help him.

104
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,100
That's why I couldn't come to visit you earlier.

105
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,190
So, you didn't

106
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,420
forget me.

107
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,360
It was destiny that made us meet.

108
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,390
How could I forget you?

109
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,590
But, I am surprised to see

110
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,750
that you are even more handsome now.

111
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,080
Am I?

112
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,300
Actually,

113
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,230
I'm here today

114
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,950
to thank you in person.

115
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,150
Thank me?

116
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,870
About the Immortal Feng's matter back then,

117
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,540
you kept it to yourself

118
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,300
that it was me who wanted

119
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,420
to see the Fire Phoenix Jade,

120
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,630
and you took full responsibility for the incident.

121
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,270
I really appreciate it.

122
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,710
Because of that,

123
00:05:58,710 --> 00:05:59,910
you were punished

124
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:01,510
by the Heavenly Empress and Lord Donghua.

125
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,750
I've been feeling sorry for that.

126
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,460
I wasn't punished severely.

127
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,800
I was only grounded

128
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,540
by my Master for a little while.

129
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,150
By the way,

130
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:11,510
Your Highness,

131
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,900
did you receive the letters I sent you?

132
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,110
The letters?

133
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,440
Of course.

134
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,980
I keep them very well.

135
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,540
Then why didn't you…

136
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,670
The Eagle Clan

137
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:24,810
has been assaulting our Bainiao Island for years.

138
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:26,050
I've been caught up in battles

139
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:27,190
and worried about my clansmen,

140
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,190
so I was too occupied

141
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,980
to write back to you.

142
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,780
Hope you won't blame me.

143
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,870
Of course not.

144
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,340
How could I blame you?

145
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:37,710
The Peacock Clan…

146
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,870
Would you like to invite me inside

147
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,020
for a chat?

148
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,640
Sure.

149
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,220
Come on in.

150
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,760
Wait a sec.

151
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,900
You idiot Gu…

152
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,190
If you don't mind,

153
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,900
just call me by my name.

154
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,870
Then I'll call you Jin in the future.

155
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,310
So, this is

156
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,660
Princess Hua Shu.

157
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:11,390
No wonder Gu Jin

158
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,830
thinks about her all the time.

159
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,900
She's pretty indeed.

160
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,980
Jin, in fact,

161
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,070
I hope you can do me a favor.

162
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,190
Your Highness, please don't say that.

163
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,350
Just feel free to ask.

164
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,550
When we were on the Wutong Island,

165
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,870
you were so kind to help me,

166
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,390
and I always remember that.

167
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,020
As long as I can,

168
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,750
I'll do my best to help you.

169
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,070
Actually,

170
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,470
I want to borrow

171
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:42,540
the Sky-shrouding Umbrella from you.

172
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,640
The Sky-shrouding Umbrella?

173
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,750
I want to use it to defend
against the Eagle Clan's attack.

174
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,070
Only for one year.

175
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,350
One year later,

176
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,360
I'll return it

177
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,660
back to you intact.

178
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,150
No, don't.

179
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,220
You can't lend her the Umbrella.

180
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,230
Yin,

181
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,630
where were you?

182
00:07:58,630 --> 00:07:59,630
I looked for you everywhere.

183
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,830
Sorry to ask, but this is…

184
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,220
This is Yin.

185
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,860
My Master took her in as a disciple

186
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,830
before he ascended to the God Realm.

187
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,270
She's my junior sister.

188
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:11,340
Lord Donghua hasn't
accepted disciples for years.

189
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,270
I didn't expect he'd take in one

190
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,710
right before he left.

191
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,190
Immortal Yin,

192
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,080
nice to meet you.

193
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,460
Your Highness,

194
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,220
with all due respect,

195
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,780
we can't lend you the Umbrella.

196
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,230
Yin.

197
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,860
Gu Jin needs to keep it for use.

198
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:28,700
He can't lend it.

199
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,960
Jin,

200
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,160
I know the Umbrella

201
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,420
is no ordinary treasure,

202
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,350
and that you can't lend it for no reason.

203
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,660
But the Bainiao Island

204
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,630
is in a life-or-death crisis right now.

205
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,190
Our clansmen are suffering heavy losses.

206
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:40,150
I can't save our clan

207
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,700
all by myself.

208
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,990
Jin, for old times' sake, please…

209
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,180
Your Highness,

210
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,300
to tell you the truth,

211
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,670
Gu Jin is about to leave the mountain
for the Demon Realm

212
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:49,510
to look for the Fire Phoenix's immortal energy

213
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,150
that he shattered by accident.

214
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,750
My Master gave him the Umbrella

215
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:54,630
for self-protection

216
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,710
because he can't even set up

217
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:56,670
the most basic

218
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,750
Moonlight Illusion Formation.

219
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,940
He hasn't even reached
the level of Junior Immortal.

220
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,230
- Yin.
- Your Highness…

221
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,110
Your Highness,

222
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,660
don't listen to her nonsense.

223
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,020
It's not nonsense.

224
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,480
You are lazy and slack

225
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,720
in training every day.

226
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,350
You really think you are
tough enough to defend yourself?

227
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,270
Do you?

228
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:12,870
It's not like what you said.

229
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:15,590
Your Highness,

230
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:16,780
I know…

231
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,310
I know you are worried about your clansmen,

232
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:19,510
but could you also worry

233
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,540
about Gu Jin's safety?

234
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,480
If you take

235
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,530
the Umbrella away,

236
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,870
it'll be like…

237
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:28,820
plucking hair from the head of…

238
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,510
of a bald man.

239
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,710
Yes, a bald man.

240
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:34,660
You've only learned a few mortal idioms,

241
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,350
and you aren't using it right.

242
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,020
- It's the truth.
- Jin.

243
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,140
I didn't know

244
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,240
Lord Donghua gave you the Umbrella

245
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,080
for self-protection.

246
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,230
I guess I put you in a difficult position.

247
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,020
Your Highness, please don't say that.

248
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,060
Sorry to bother you.

249
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,260
I'll leave now.

250
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,820
Thank you, Your Highness.

251
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,660
Take care, Jin.

252
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,900
Your… Your Highness.

253
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,750
Your Highness.

254
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,920
Come back.

255
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,150
What are you doing?

256
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,200
- Yin, you…
- I've told you,

257
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,040
- You can't lend it.
- Your Highness.

258
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,470
- Wait for me. I'll walk you out.
- Seriously, you can't lend it.

259
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,110
Yin, stop messing around.

260
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:08,660
Let me walk you out.

261
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,350
Your…

262
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:49,750
Could you stop already?

263
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,780
I can't believe how narrow-minded you are.

264
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,030
You enjoy using the master-servant contract

265
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,060
to trick me,

266
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,200
so I'm using it

267
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,300
to make you run.

268
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,850
I stopped you from lending the Umbrella

269
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:03,220
because

270
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,140
I know your cultivation base is low

271
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,900
and you can't defend yourself.

272
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,590
I did it for your own good.

273
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:09,750
Enjoy your running.

274
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,540
I'll go to bed now.

275
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,390
Enough is enough.

276
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,780
Don't go. You…

277
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,630
Yin, Yin.

278
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:22,870
This is…

279
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,470
Yin,

280
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,780
why are you running this late?

281
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,020
Working out?

282
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,110
Yes.

283
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,320
I've been

284
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,420
working out a lot lately.

285
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,900
I… I like

286
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,540
to run like this.

287
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,590
Look, these are the biographies

288
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:38,540
of the well-known immortal beasts

289
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:41,060
in the Three Realms you asked for.

290
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:41,900
Take a look.

291
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:42,960
Here, give me.

292
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,750
- Right here. Here you go.
- Give me.

293
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,470
When I was A Pet in the Heavenly Palace.

294
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:51,470
No, it won't work.

295
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:54,390
The Stories

296
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:57,750
between Me and My Master.

297
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:58,960
Not gonna work either.

298
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,020
Useful Tips

299
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,230
for Taming My Master.

300
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,200
I heard…

301
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,420
I heard the writer of this book

302
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,870
not only helped his Master

303
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:10,910
successfully ascend to the God Realm

304
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,470
through his hard work,

305
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:13,390
but also trained himself

306
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,230
into a senior immortal.

307
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:15,720
He's got great reputation

308
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,230
in the immortal beasts' world.

309
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,540
"Restrained by the rules
of the master-servant contract,

310
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:21,710
spiritual beasts

311
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:24,200
cannot fight the contract forcibly."

312
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,040
I'm exhausted.

313
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,820
"Don't be afraid to think outside the box.

314
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,270
Cater to his tastes

315
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,110
and humor his needs

316
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,720
by praising and encouraging him."

317
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,990
Would you like to take a break?

318
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,020
No.

319
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,160
I'll keep this one.

320
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,600
You can go back now.

321
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,990
I'll keep running.

322
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:43,060
Alright.

323
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:00,340
(The entrance, Daze Mountain)

324
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,580
What took you so long?

325
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,630
I've been waiting for you.

326
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,940
Why don't you try running the whole night?

327
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:19,510
Let's go.

328
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,240
(According to the book,)

329
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,750
(I can't openly defy the master of the contract.)

330
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,510
(Instead, I should cater to his tastes)

331
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,660
(to get what I want.)

332
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,590
(Let me give it a try.)

333
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,550
You've been saying that you wanted

334
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:36,300
to try the mung bean cake from the mortal world.

335
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:39,600
I learned how to make it
and made some for you last night.

336
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,590
Try it.

337
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,150
You put poison in it, didn't you?

338
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:43,940
Why would I do that?

339
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,750
I want to apologize to you

340
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,420
for yesterday.

341
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,150
Really?

342
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:52,390
You made it yourself?

343
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,440
Or what?

344
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:02,350
Tastes good?

345
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,320
Not bad.

346
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,150
Then about yesterday…

347
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,470
Whether or not

348
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,300
I'll forgive you depends on your behavior.

349
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:16,020
Make more of this when you have time.

350
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:18,710
Let's go.

351
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,440
Come on.

352
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:22,630
Coming.

353
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,940
(He forgave me already?)

354
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,590
(Are you kidding?)

355
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,240
(The tips for taming)

356
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,950
(worked very well.)

357
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:47,270
Jin, Yin.

358
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,040
Senior brother.

359
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,150
Why are you all here?

360
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,270
You don't have to see us off.

361
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:57,830
We only go down the mountain
to fetch the immortal energy.

362
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:58,670
We'll be back soon.

363
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,750
And my spiritual power

364
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,230
has improved a lot.

365
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:02,660
I can protect myself and her.

366
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:03,750
Yin,

367
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,660
make sure to protect Jin well.

368
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,750
We'll count on you.

369
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,940
You got it.

370
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:10,440
I will take good care of him.

371
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,280
Rest assured.

372
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:12,510
Jin,

373
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:13,720
according to Master's instructions,

374
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,190
Hong Ruo, the Demon Lord of the Fox Clan,

375
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:16,910
is very close to Feng Yuan,
the Heavenly Empress,

376
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,270
so you guys can go to the Fox Clan

377
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,390
in the Jingyou Valley

378
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:20,630
of the Demon Realm to find the parasol tree first,

379
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,110
and then head to Ziyue Mountain.

380
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,350
Understood.

381
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,230
The Immortal and the Demon Realms have been
holding a deep grudge against each other.

382
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,350
When you enter the Demon Realm,

383
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,420
you've got to be extra cautious.

384
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,680
Got it.

385
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,800
We are leaving.

386
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,470
Have a safe trip.

387
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:34,660
Let's go.

388
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:40,390
Congratulations

389
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:41,630
on breaking through the Gate of Life and Death

390
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,390
and entering the Third Heaven.

391
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,150
(Back then, my parents)

392
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:55,350
(fell into the immortals' trap)

393
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,780
(and died in the battle.)

394
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,780
(The Nirvana Wheel was also taken.)

395
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:03,240
(Heize Pool, the Third Heaven, the Demon Realm)
(I must forge a weapon)

396
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,900
(in this Heize Pool for myself,)

397
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:07,910
(and then go to the Immortal Realm)

398
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,980
(to get the Nirvana Wheel back.)

399
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,110
The Nirvana Wheel.

400
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,030
Those in the Three Realms

401
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,260
who swallow the energy of their own kind

402
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:15,660
will fall and become devils.

403
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:17,830
Once a year,

404
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,830
the Half-god Demon Dragon
that guards the Abyssal Prison

405
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:22,550
(The Barrier entrance, Abyssal Prison)
will drive the newfound devils

406
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:23,790
into the prison.

407
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,720
I want you

408
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,390
to lure Hong Yi

409
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,220
into the prison at that time.

410
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,420
(Abyssal Prison)

411
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,660
He's mine.

412
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,040
My son,

413
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:26,940
go under the parasol tree in the southeast.

414
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,940
It's a tree from the God Realm.

415
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,660
The devils can't hurt it.

416
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:17,900
(Jingyou Valley, the Second Heaven, the Demon Realm)

417
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:25,350
How is it going?

418
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,830
(Hong Mei, Elder of the Fox Clan)
I sent someone to follow His Highness secretly.

419
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:30,100
But he suddenly disappeared as soon

420
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,180
as he broke into the Third Heaven.

421
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,430
Have you asked our allies

422
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:33,500
in the Third Heaven?

423
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,660
I have.

424
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,180
How could this happen?

425
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,830
I'm Hong Ruo of the Fox Clan
in the Jingyou Mountain.

426
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,740
I came to Ziyue Mountain for an urgent matter.

427
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,220
Ziyue Mountain

428
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:09,940
is True God Di Juan's cultivation place.

429
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,350
He has returned to the Ancient God Realm.

430
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:13,830
No visitors.

431
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:14,700
But I…

432
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,300
(The Demon Realm)

433
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:31,810
So, this is the Demon Realm.

434
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:32,650
- I think…
- Shh.

435
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,030
Lower your voice, will you?

436
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,070
Don't blame me for not warning you.

437
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:38,070
The Immortal Realm and the Demon Realm

438
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:39,390
don't get along.

439
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:40,400
Your healing power

440
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,240
is quite weak.

441
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:42,940
You got to be careful, or a demon will attack you,

442
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,060
take your internal core, and devour you.

443
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:45,900
Got it?

444
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:51,900
Based on the story books,

445
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,260
there are a lot of dashing

446
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,830
and handsome demon lords here.

447
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:57,830
Is that true?

448
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:02,310
Look at you, so ignorant.

449
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,430
Those handsome demons you talked about

450
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:07,190
are all powerful demons

451
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:08,260
who've entered the Second Heaven

452
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:09,480
through cultivation,

453
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,900
so they can take on attractive appearances.

454
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:13,190
While those ordinary small demons

455
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:14,660
can't take on human forms at all.

456
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,020
They can be very ugly.

457
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,110
So, which level are we on right now?

458
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:21,190
The Second Heaven.

459
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,180
In that case,

460
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:23,680
I do have a chance

461
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,260
to see some handsome demon lords.

462
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,200
Do you still remember

463
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,870
why we came here?

464
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,390
We are here to look
for the immortal energy of Feng Yin.

465
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,590
You look like you are here for a date.

466
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,940
Don't talk nonsense.

467
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:41,440
If I were to date someone,

468
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,310
I'd chose a guy from the Third Heaven.

469
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:46,700
The Third Heaven?

470
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,400
The Third Heaven

471
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,980
is the place where the Demon King lives.

472
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,390
But the Ziyue Mountain we are heading

473
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:53,870
is actually in the Third Heaven.

474
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,160
Shall I introduce you

475
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,070
to the Demon King?

476
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,220
Why…

477
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,660
Why did you reveal your original form?

478
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,900
Change your form back, now.

479
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,300
If you get caught,

480
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,900
I won't be able to get you back.
Hurry, change back.

481
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:14,260
I can't help.

482
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:16,740
The demonic power
in the mountain is too overwhelming.

483
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,900
One hundred years ago,

484
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,150
the Fox Queen Hong Ruo started to rise.

485
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:20,790
Under her leadership, the Fox Clan

486
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:22,260
became the biggest clan in the Demon Realm.

487
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:24,070
This place is not to be underestimated.

488
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,260
Your comments on our Fox Clan

489
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:29,070
makes me feel flattered.

490
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:37,430
Come here.

491
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:38,700
This demon's got high spiritual power.

492
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,000
I bet he's long sensed

493
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,840
our immortal aura.

494
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,000
We must be careful.

495
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,900
Will he find out about me?

496
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,800
No.

497
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:48,350
Before we left,

498
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:50,500
I asked Xian Shan to cast a spell on you.

499
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,160
In outsiders' eyes,

500
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,150
you are just

501
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:54,630
a spiritual cat.

502
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:56,630
A spiritual cat.

503
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,240
- I…
- Shh.

504
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:03,700
I'm Hong Huo.

505
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:06,390
May I know who are here

506
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:07,830
to visit our Jingyou Mountain?

507
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,390
We are Gu Jin and Yin

508
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:13,190
from Daze Mountain.

509
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:14,980
We are here to visit Hong Ruo, the Fox Queen.

510
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,260
So, you are Lord Donghua's disciples.

511
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,000
In that case,

512
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,630
please come with me.

513
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,240
Let's go.

514
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,570
Careful. Don't run around.

515
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:31,070
So beautiful.

516
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:46,390
Stop it.

517
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,200
The disciples of the Daze Mountain

518
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,980
are trained to be righteous and moral.

519
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,460
They won't be easily enchanted.

520
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,350
Remove the spell.

521
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,280
Let's go.

522
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,830
I'm Gu Jin of Daze Mountain.

523
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:14,980
Greetings, Your Highness,

524
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:16,260
Elders.

525
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:22,910
Gu Jin.

526
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,550
You've grown up.

527
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,920
Shouldn't you go look

528
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,180
for the immortal energy of Feng Yin?

529
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:30,660
What did you come here for?

530
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,790
Actually, that's exactly the reason

531
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:33,070
why I'm here.

532
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:38,440
This is part of the immortal energy

533
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,000
of Feng Yin I found in a parasol tree

534
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,350
by accident.

535
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,720
My Master told me

536
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,590
that the rest of the pieces

537
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:45,830
might scatter in the parasol trees

538
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,460
in all Three Realms,

539
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:48,590
including

540
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:52,030
the one in the Jingyou Valley of the Fox Clan.

541
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:54,830
So, Your Highness,

542
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:56,340
I hope you can let me

543
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,720
enter the Jingyou Valley

544
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,830
and take a look.

545
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,830
That's ridiculous.

546
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:03,880
The Jingyou Valley is a holy place of our clan

547
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,230
where we breed young.

548
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:06,070
How could we let you, an immortal,

549
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:06,910
get close to it?

550
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,000
Even if Lord Donghua

551
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,310
came here in person today,

552
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,510
we wouldn't let him enter,

553
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:11,630
let alone you.

554
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,350
We promise we'll only fetch the energy piece.

555
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:16,150
We will not touch the parasol tree.

556
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,310
Your Highness,

557
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,310
on the account
of the Heavenly Empress Feng Yuan

558
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:22,630
and the Wutong Island,

559
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,090
please allow me to try.

560
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:25,500
(Because of him,
my precious disciple Feng Yuan)

561
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,460
(lost all her immortal energy back then.)

562
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,990
(I can't believe he can still manage)

563
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:30,590
(to get the support
from Feng Yuan and Dong Hua.)

564
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,390
(I'm afraid he's not as simple as he seems.)

565
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,700
(Since I can't go into the Ziyue Mountain,)

566
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,550
(maybe this kid has a way)

567
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:37,660
(of entering it.)

568
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:39,310
It's not impossible

569
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:40,350
for you to enter the Jingyou Valley.

570
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:43,030
But you aren't our clansmen,

571
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,110
I can't make the exception for you

572
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:45,350
for no reason

573
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:46,880
even on the account

574
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,940
of Feng Yuan.

575
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,350
Then, Your Highness,

576
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,190
what do you want from us?

577
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,240
Yin.

578
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,740
You are quite smart.

579
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:55,390
My nephew Nine-tailed Fox Hong Yi

580
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,900
went missing in the Ziyue Mountain a while ago.

581
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,350
If you can help me find him back,

582
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:01,940
I'll allow you

583
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:03,740
to enter the Jingyou Valley.

584
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,590
Hong Yi went missing in the mountain?

585
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:07,870
That's right.

586
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,940
In the Third Heaven,

587
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:12,900
where the origin of Hong Meng
of the Demon Realm is at.

588
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:13,990
The Demon Realm.

589
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:14,830
What do you think?

590
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:20,110
Alright.

591
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,540
There's also

592
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:22,500
a parasol tree in the Ziyue Mountain,

593
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,110
where we are going to visit anyway.

594
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,940
I'd like to help you find your nephew back.

595
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,590
Then it's a deal.

596
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:30,630
I'll stay here

597
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:33,180
and wait for you to bring Hong Yi back.

598
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,030
What kind of a place the Ziyue Mountain is?

599
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,310
Why is everybody afraid of it?

600
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:40,010
The Ziyue Mountain

601
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:42,330
is the place where Di Juan,

602
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:43,350
one of the two True Gods,

603
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:44,550
used to dwell.

604
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:46,230
The Purple Moon he had

605
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:47,900
was the power source
of the entire Demon Realm.

606
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,980
So, the demons were all afraid of him.

607
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:51,750
Besides, there's a powerful Barrier

608
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:52,700
protecting the mountain.

609
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,470
Those who trespass on it

610
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:57,420
will be torn apart by the power of the Barrier.

611
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,260
In that case,

612
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:03,110
how are we supposed to get in?

613
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,550
Princess Hua Shu.

614
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,400
How dare you

615
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,580
(Yan Shuang, the Princess of the Eagle Clan)
steal from us?

616
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:26,070
Hand over the Blue Blood Reishi.

617
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,280
No way.

618
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:42,660
The Reishi.

619
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,260
Your Highness.

620
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,320
Sky-shrouding Umbrella.

621
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,940
Your Highness, are you alright?

622
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:08,430
I'm fine.

623
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,520
Come on.

624
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,350
Five against one.

625
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,180
It's so unfair.

626
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,030
Who are you?

627
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,180
Gu Jin of Daze Mountain.

628
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,500
Yin of Daze Mountain.

629
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:25,910
Fine.

630
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,900
I, Yan Shuang, will remember you two.

631
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,240
Let's go.

632
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,390
Thank you, Jin.

633
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:41,950
Don't mention it.

634
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,040
Your Highness,

635
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,110
who are

636
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:46,070
those people?

637
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,590
Why did they fight you over that thing?

638
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:50,350
My father's immortal energy was damaged

639
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,550
after fighting the Eagle King.

640
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,660
In the Three Realms,

641
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,240
only the Blue Blood Reishi

642
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,460
can heal his injury.

643
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:00,900
To kill my father, the Eagle Clan

644
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,740
kept trying to take it from me,

645
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:04,740
or destroy it if they can't have it.

646
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,260
The Eagle Clan has gone too far.

647
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:09,940
The one you saw

648
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,150
is Yan Shuang, the Princess of the Eagle Clan.

649
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:14,030
As the Princess

650
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:15,110
of the Bainiao Island,

651
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,590
I've never thought

652
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:18,260
I'd be bullied like this.

653
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,520
Your Highness,

654
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:24,310
you are injured.

655
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:25,870
Let's find an inn

656
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:26,900
so you can take a rest.

657
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:32,670
Your Highness,

658
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:34,460
put this on.

659
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,030
- Here.
- Thanks.

660
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,560
Let's go.

661
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:50,590
It's quite warm, isn't it?

662
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:02,390
Careful.

663
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:16,670
Your Highness, rest well.

664
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:17,740
We'll leave now.

665
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:18,580
Thank you.

666
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:19,590
Let's go.

667
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:25,660
Your Highness, you are suffering
from an internal injury.

668
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,630
You need to take some spiritual herbs.

669
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:28,800
Yin,

670
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,350
go get some spiritual herbs.

671
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,000
Me?

672
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,150
I need to stay here and take care of her.

673
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:37,670
Go on.

674
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,590
Thank you, Yin.

675
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,550
I really appreciate it.

676
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:48,190
You are welcome.

677
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:52,660
Come back soon.

678
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,300
But,

679
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,950
Your Highness, you've long reached

680
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:13,030
the level of Junior Immortal, right?

681
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:16,030
How come your spiritual power is still weak?

682
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,220
The Eagle Clan has been fighting me
over the Blue Blood Reishi,

683
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,470
and my father's life is in danger.

684
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,630
I had to use my own spiritual power

685
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,820
to protect my father's Spiritual Core.

686
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,910
Then how are you supposed to defend yourself?

687
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,470
I can't worry about that for now.

688
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,070
I've got to go back.

689
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:39,950
Otherwise, the Eagle Clan
will attack our island again

690
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,630
if they find out I'm not there.

691
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,990
Gu Jin is such an idiot.

692
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,950
He totally threw himself

693
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:50,300
at her feet as soon as he saw her.

694
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,150
He'll be in big trouble.

695
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,150
But it's none of my business.

696
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:55,430
Let him be.

697
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,950
There's nothing I can do anyway.

698
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:06,390
Jin.

699
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:14,950
Didn't I just walk past here a minute ago?

700
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,760
Your Highness,

701
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:24,050
you aren't recovered yet.

702
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:26,130
Even if you go back now, you still can't…

703
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:27,950
I must do whatever it takes

704
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:29,830
to protect

705
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:30,700
my clansmen.

706
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:32,510
Worse comes to the worst,

707
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:35,630
if I agree to marry
into the immortal clan of the South Sea,

708
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:37,150
our Bainiao Island

709
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,310
will no longer

710
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:40,260
be supportless

711
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,820
and helpless like this.

712
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:43,510
How could you agree to such an arrangement

713
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:45,430
at the cost of your own happiness?

714
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,550
I'll only go for it

715
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:48,030
as the last resort.

716
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:49,700
You don't have to worry.

717
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:52,340
I've been training hard lately.

718
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:53,940
Maybe

719
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,470
I can find a shortcut

720
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:56,340
to improve my cultivation base quickly.

721
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,310
At that time,

722
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:58,910
the Eagle Clan will have to stand down.

723
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,240
Your Highness,

724
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:09,550
I'll lend you

725
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:10,550
the Sky-shrouding Umbrella.

726
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:13,380
I think with the protection
of the Umbrella barrier,

727
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:15,700
your clan can absolutely
defend against the enemy.

728
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,280
Jin.

729
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:21,150
Don't look at me like this.

730
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,030
Just an umbrella. It's no big deal.

731
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,030
What matters right now is to solve the crisis

732
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:25,910
that the Bainiao Island is facing.

733
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,260
Please take it.

734
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,950
I really appreciate

735
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,700
your kindness and help.

736
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:53,110
Jin.

737
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:59,390
I'm here.

738
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:01,030
Yin.

739
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,320
Yin.

740
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:05,590
I'm here.

741
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,430
Where are you?

742
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:09,590
This inn is like a maze.

743
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:17,070
So dumb.

744
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:21,070
Master-servant contract?

745
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,310
Isn't Yin

746
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:25,320
Lord Donghua's

747
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,180
registered disciple?

748
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,380
How come…

749
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,340
Yin's spiritual power is weak,

750
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,320
so my Master asked me to protect her

751
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,260
in this way.

752
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,700
Yin has never

753
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,030
left Daze Mountain before.

754
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:39,390
She has no any sense of direction.

755
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,030
I may as well just summon her back directly.

756
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,550
I see.

757
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,160
Come back.

758
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,950
You are so silly.

759
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,270
How could you get lost

760
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:07,180
in a small inn like this?

761
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:08,020
Couldn't you find your way?

762
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:09,950
No, I…

763
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,820
Here you go.

764
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,120
Alright,

765
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,220
stay here.

766
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,150
Don't run around anymore.

767
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,160
Your Highness,

768
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,390
I'll let the waiter

769
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:26,340
to decoct the medicine for you.

770
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,030
Thank you.

771
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,590
What are you looking at?

772
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,950
Take care of Her Highness.

773
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:41,340
Your Highness, would you like some water?

774
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:42,350
No need.

775
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,260
I still have things to do. I've got to go.

776
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,740
Hold on.

777
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,820
He went to decoct the medicine for you.

778
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:50,860
If he comes back and sees that you've left,

779
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:52,380
he'll go through the trouble for nothing.

780
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:53,390
Why don't you wait for him?

781
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:55,150
You can leave after he's back.

782
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:58,660
I don't need a servant like you

783
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,910
to tell me what to do.

784
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:03,740
He told you that?

785
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:06,060
How I talk to your master

786
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,340
and what we talk about

787
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:08,740
is none of your concern.

788
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:10,320
As a servant,

789
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,340
you should focus on doing your job right.

790
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,470
The medicine is ready.

791
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:36,180
Where's Princess Hua Shu?

792
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:37,870
She left.

793
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,950
Left?

794
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:41,820
She… She's still wounded.

795
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,230
Yin, I told you to keep her stay.

796
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:45,070
How?

797
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,800
As a servant,

798
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,700
I should focus on my own job.

799
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,550
Do I have the right to interfere in the matter

800
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,470
between my master and the princess? No.

801
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,180
What's wrong?

802
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:55,990
Why are you mad?

803
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:57,510
Did I do something?

804
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:00,590
Why did you tell Hua Shu

805
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,740
about the master-servant contract thing?

806
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,430
Because you were looking for me.

807
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,870
I wanted to summon you back,

808
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:08,990
so I uttered the spell,

809
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,630
and Hua Shu saw it through.

810
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,320
Don't worry.

811
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,030
Princess Hua Shu is pretty and kind.

812
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:16,380
She wouldn't think too much of it.

813
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,660
She just…

814
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:21,390
She…

815
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:24,180
Pretty and kind.

816
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,990
Back then on the Wutong Island,

817
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,360
she helped me

818
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,950
when she didn't even know me.

819
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:30,860
Apparently, she's a kind-hearted person.

820
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,260
Come on, don't be mad.

821
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,640
Yin.

822
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,800
Actually,

823
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,340
I got hurt too

824
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:50,820
when I tried to save her.

825
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:52,550
It really hurts.

826
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,340
You deserve it.

827
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:06,510
Good.

828
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,160
I feel much better now.

829
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:10,070
I knew

830
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,400
our Yin

831
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,320
still cared deeply about me.

832
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,210
Not really.

833
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:15,110
I was just worried that you'd slow me down.

834
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,640
You big fool.

835
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,960
All you can think about

836
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,260
is Hua Shu.

837
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,750
You got hurt for saving her life,

838
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:21,590
yet she left

839
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,700
without even saying goodbye to you.

840
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:24,300
Don't you think it's strange?

841
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:26,510
She's worried about the Bainiao Island.

842
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,740
You still need to go

843
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:28,860
to the Ziyue Mountain for a mission.

844
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:30,700
You don't have time
to concern about the Bainiao Island.

845
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:31,860
How could you…

846
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,430
Look how worried you are.

847
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,280
Alright,

848
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,840
I'll

849
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:38,110
stop pretending.

850
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:39,600
Yes,

851
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:40,550
it's true that ordinary people

852
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,660
dare not approach the Ziyue Mountain,

853
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,470
but I'm no ordinary person.

854
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,790
I'm very resourceful.

855
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:49,740
With my power and strength,

856
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:50,870
I can easily

857
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:52,190
take you into

858
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:53,110
the Ziyue Mountain.

859
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,280
Really?

860
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:57,430
You bet.

861
00:41:58,230 --> 00:41:59,910
I'll be damned if I believe you.

862
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,700
You don't? Come with me.

863
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,210
I'm not going.

864
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:04,260
Why not? Come on.

865
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:05,920
I'll show you

866
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:06,860
my true power.

867
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,340
So, this is the Ziyue Mountain.

868
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:19,070
The demonic aura here is so strong.

869
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,880
No matter ordinary immortals and demons

870
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,740
dare not to get close to it.

871
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:23,030
Tell me about it.

872
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,060
Without permission,

873
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:26,300
ordinary half-gods aren't allowed in at all.

874
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:28,660
But it's different

875
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:29,510
when it comes to me.

876
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:31,070
Watch.

877
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,070
You'll just go in like this?

878
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:36,350
Or what?

879
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,720
Don't worry.

880
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,340
I've got a trump card.

881
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:41,860
But you should at least prepare a visiting note.

882
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:43,320
It's rude for you to go in like this.

883
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,550
Who are you?

884
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:46,740
How dare you trespass on the Ziyue Mountain?

885
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:55,230
It's you,

886
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:56,740
you three-headed guy.

887
00:42:57,710 --> 00:42:58,550
Don't you recognize me?

888
00:42:58,880 --> 00:42:59,740
Watch your mouth.

889
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,990
I'm the Dragon Lord guarding the mountain.

890
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,740
You are insolent and impudent.

891
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:06,260
Get lost, now.

892
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,910
This is the trump card you talked about?

893
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:17,070
I…

894
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,350
I know Bibo.

895
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:22,220
Bibo.

896
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:27,840
Stop.

897
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:29,400
(Bibo, Water Divine Beast)

898
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,590
You stupid dragon.

899
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,260
Are you blind even with six eyes?

900
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:34,180
If you hurt my…

901
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:38,800
The cousin of the neighbor

902
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,300
of the distant nephew of my seventh aunt,

903
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:41,820
I'll make you pay for it.

904
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:50,260
(Three-headed Fire Dragon)

905
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:54,950
- I'm also…
- Are you alright?

906
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,600
I'm fine.

907
00:43:58,190 --> 00:43:59,270
My nephew,

908
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:00,280
it's been over 100 years.

909
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:01,500
You finally came to visit me.

910
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:02,700
I missed you so much.

911
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:03,950
Give me a hug.

912
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,260
I'm also… I…

913
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,200
Bibo.

914
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,430
Have you ever seen

915
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:19,110
a Nine-tailed Fox in the Ziyue Mountain?

916
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:28,820
(Bibo Hut, the Ziyue Mountain)

917
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:29,820
I've searched telepathically,

918
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:33,480
and there are no traces

919
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,350
of a Nine-tailed Fox here.

920
00:44:35,350 --> 00:44:36,260
No?

921
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:37,510
How's that possible?

922
00:44:38,030 --> 00:44:39,550
The Fox Queen Hong Ruo was pretty sure

923
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:41,590
that her nephew went into the Ziyue Mountain.

924
00:44:43,070 --> 00:44:44,470
If he's not here,

925
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,100
how are we supposed to go to the Jingyou Valley

926
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,340
to find the immortal energy of the Fire Phoenix?

927
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:50,390
Bibo,

928
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:52,380
before my Master ascended to the God Realm,

929
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,100
he told me there's also

930
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:55,030
a parasol tree in the Ziyue Mountain.

931
00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:56,860
There is one.

932
00:44:57,230 --> 00:44:58,070
But,

933
00:44:58,150 --> 00:44:58,990
why do you ask?

934
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:01,590
The Fire Phoenix's immortal energy
shattered because of me.

935
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,190
My Master said her immortal energy

936
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:04,990
could scatter in the parasol trees.

937
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:06,590
You want me to take you

938
00:45:06,590 --> 00:45:07,430
to the tree?

939
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:08,550
That's right.

940
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:10,020
