00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.620
(Yantian Hall)

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.190
Lord Donghua ascended to the God Realm.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:55.760
I'm here to congratulate him

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:56.830
on behalf of the Bainiao Island.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.840
Your Highness,

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.850
thank you for coming.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:59.840
My father should've come here

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.190
to congratulate him in person,

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:02.640
but he went to the battle

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.300
a while ago to defend the Bainiao Island,

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.500
and he hasn't recovered from his injury,

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.430
so he sent me.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.580
May I

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.510
meet with Lord Donghua?

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:11.680
My Master has just ascended

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.520
to the God Realm.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:13.870
He asked the two of us

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:14.940
to say goodbye

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.230
to everyone on his behalf.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.340
Actually,

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.020
there's something else

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.510
that brought me here today.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.140
I wonder if I can

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.190
borrow Lord Donghua's

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.300
Sky-shrouding Umbrella

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.510
to fend off the invasion of the Eagle Clan.

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.030
Hongque.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.740
This is Peacock Feather Crown,

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:39.780
a holy treasure of our Peacock Clan.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.390
We'd like to give it to Daze Mountain

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.020
in exchange of borrowing
the Umbrella for one year.

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:45.510
Your Highness,

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.430
I'm afraid we can't lend it to you.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.740
Before my Master left,

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:50.620
he already gave the Umbrella

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:51.990
to Gu Jin.

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.870
The Umbrella is now Gu Jin's

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:54.950
personal weapon.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.510
We can't speak for him.

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.390
Please try to understand, Your Highness.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.840
Gu Jin.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.360
Yin.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.620
Yin.

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.780
Thanks to my hard training,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.020
my spiritual power improved again.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.590
I can finally stay further

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:41.460
from that fool.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.430
Can I take another step forward?

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:54.550
Where is she?

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.470
She's supposed to prepare
for going down the mountain tomorrow.

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:07.510
Where did she go?

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.510
So troublesome.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.990
Yin.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.830
Your Highness, why do you have
to go visit him in person?

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.910
You could just wait in the hall

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.190
and send a message,

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:23.820
and that Immortal Gu Jin

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.190
will come to visit you for sure.

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.040
With Lord Donghua ascending to the God Realm,

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.020
Senior Immortal Xian Shan
is now in charge of Daze Mountain.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.550
And Gu Jin is the Chief Elder

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:32.390
of Daze Mountain.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.660
There's nothing improper for me to visit him.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.220
Immortal Gu Jin.

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:54.980
Are you Immortal Gu Jin?

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:58.900
Your Highness.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.950
(Inaction)
Your Highness, long time no see.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.420
You are really Immortal Gu Jin.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.750
I'm here to pay you a visit.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.070
Pay me a visit?

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.020
After we parted from Wutong Island,

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.300
I was going to come
to Daze Mountain to see you.

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.310
Unfortunately, our Peacock Clan
has been battling

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:22.660
against the Eagle Clan these years.

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.830
I had to stay with my father and help him.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.100
That's why I couldn't come to visit you earlier.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.190
So, you didn't

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:30.420
forget me.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.360
It was destiny that made us meet.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.390
How could I forget you?

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.590
But, I am surprised to see

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.750
that you are even more handsome now.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.080
Am I?

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:42.300
Actually,

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.230
I'm here today

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:44.950
to thank you in person.

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:46.150
Thank me?

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:47.870
About the Immortal Feng's matter back then,

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.540
you kept it to yourself

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.300
that it was me who wanted

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:52.420
to see the Fire Phoenix Jade,

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.630
and you took full responsibility for the incident.

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:56.270
I really appreciate it.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.710
Because of that,

00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:59.910
you were punished

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:01.510
by the Heavenly Empress and Lord Donghua.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.750
I've been feeling sorry for that.

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.460
I wasn't punished severely.

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:06.800
I was only grounded

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.540
by my Master for a little while.

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:10.150
By the way,

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:11.510
Your Highness,

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.900
did you receive the letters I sent you?

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:15.110
The letters?

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.440
Of course.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.980
I keep them very well.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.540
Then why didn't you…

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:22.670
The Eagle Clan

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:24.810
has been assaulting our Bainiao Island for years.

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:26.050
I've been caught up in battles

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:27.190
and worried about my clansmen,

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.190
so I was too occupied

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:30.980
to write back to you.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.780
Hope you won't blame me.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:33.870
Of course not.

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:35.340
How could I blame you?

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:37.710
The Peacock Clan…

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:39.870
Would you like to invite me inside

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.020
for a chat?

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:43.640
Sure.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.220
Come on in.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:51.760
Wait a sec.

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:57.900
You idiot Gu…

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:03.190
If you don't mind,

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:04.900
just call me by my name.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.870
Then I'll call you Jin in the future.

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:08.310
So, this is

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:09.660
Princess Hua Shu.

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:11.390
No wonder Gu Jin

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:12.830
thinks about her all the time.

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:14.900
She's pretty indeed.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.980
Jin, in fact,

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:20.070
I hope you can do me a favor.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.190
Your Highness, please don't say that.

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:24.350
Just feel free to ask.

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:26.550
When we were on the Wutong Island,

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:27.870
you were so kind to help me,

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:29.390
and I always remember that.

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:31.020
As long as I can,

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:32.750
I'll do my best to help you.

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:38.070
Actually,

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.470
I want to borrow

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:42.540
the Sky-shrouding Umbrella from you.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:43.640
The Sky-shrouding Umbrella?

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:45.750
I want to use it to defend
against the Eagle Clan's attack.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.070
Only for one year.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.350
One year later,

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:49.360
I'll return it

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.660
back to you intact.

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:52.150
No, don't.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.220
You can't lend her the Umbrella.

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:57.230
Yin,

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:58.630
where were you?

00:07:58.630 --> 00:07:59.630
I looked for you everywhere.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.830
Sorry to ask, but this is…

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:04.220
This is Yin.

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:05.860
My Master took her in as a disciple

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:06.830
before he ascended to the God Realm.

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:08.270
She's my junior sister.

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:11.340
Lord Donghua hasn't
accepted disciples for years.

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:13.270
I didn't expect he'd take in one

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:14.710
right before he left.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.190
Immortal Yin,

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:18.080
nice to meet you.

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:21.460
Your Highness,

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:23.220
with all due respect,

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:24.780
we can't lend you the Umbrella.

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:26.230
Yin.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.860
Gu Jin needs to keep it for use.

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:28.700
He can't lend it.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:29.960
Jin,

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:31.160
I know the Umbrella

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.420
is no ordinary treasure,

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.350
and that you can't lend it for no reason.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.660
But the Bainiao Island

00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:37.630
is in a life-or-death crisis right now.

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:39.190
Our clansmen are suffering heavy losses.

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:40.150
I can't save our clan

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:41.700
all by myself.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.990
Jin, for old times' sake, please…

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:45.180
Your Highness,

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:46.300
to tell you the truth,

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:48.670
Gu Jin is about to leave the mountain
for the Demon Realm

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:49.510
to look for the Fire Phoenix's immortal energy

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:51.150
that he shattered by accident.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:53.750
My Master gave him the Umbrella

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:54.630
for self-protection

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:55.710
because he can't even set up

00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:56.670
the most basic

00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:57.750
Moonlight Illusion Formation.

00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:59.940
He hasn't even reached
the level of Junior Immortal.

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.230
- Yin.
- Your Highness…

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:03.110
Your Highness,

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:04.660
don't listen to her nonsense.

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:06.020
It's not nonsense.

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:07.480
You are lazy and slack

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:08.720
in training every day.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.350
You really think you are
tough enough to defend yourself?

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:11.270
Do you?

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:12.870
It's not like what you said.

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:15.590
Your Highness,

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:16.780
I know…

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:18.310
I know you are worried about your clansmen,

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:19.510
but could you also worry

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:20.540
about Gu Jin's safety?

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.480
If you take

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:23.530
the Umbrella away,

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:25.870
it'll be like…

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:28.820
plucking hair from the head of…

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:30.510
of a bald man.

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:32.710
Yes, a bald man.

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:34.660
You've only learned a few mortal idioms,

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:36.350
and you aren't using it right.

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:38.020
- It's the truth.
- Jin.

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.140
I didn't know

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:41.240
Lord Donghua gave you the Umbrella

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.080
for self-protection.

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:45.230
I guess I put you in a difficult position.

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:47.020
Your Highness, please don't say that.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.060
Sorry to bother you.

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:50.260
I'll leave now.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:51.820
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:53.660
Take care, Jin.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:56.900
Your… Your Highness.

00:09:58.840 --> 00:09:59.750
Your Highness.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:00.920
Come back.

00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:02.150
What are you doing?

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:03.200
- Yin, you…
- I've told you,

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.040
- You can't lend it.
- Your Highness.

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:05.470
- Wait for me. I'll walk you out.
- Seriously, you can't lend it.

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:07.110
Yin, stop messing around.

00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:08.660
Let me walk you out.

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:12.350
Your…

00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:49.750
Could you stop already?

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:52.780
I can't believe how narrow-minded you are.

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:55.030
You enjoy using the master-servant contract

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:56.060
to trick me,

00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:58.200
so I'm using it

00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.300
to make you run.

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.850
I stopped you from lending the Umbrella

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:03.220
because

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:05.140
I know your cultivation base is low

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:06.900
and you can't defend yourself.

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.590
I did it for your own good.

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:09.750
Enjoy your running.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:11.540
I'll go to bed now.

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.390
Enough is enough.

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:16.780
Don't go. You…

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:20.630
Yin, Yin.

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:22.870
This is…

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:24.470
Yin,

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:25.780
why are you running this late?

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.020
Working out?

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:29.110
Yes.

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:30.320
I've been

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:32.420
working out a lot lately.

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:33.900
I… I like

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:35.540
to run like this.

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:37.590
Look, these are the biographies

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:38.540
of the well-known immortal beasts

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:41.060
in the Three Realms you asked for.

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:41.900
Take a look.

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:42.960
Here, give me.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.750
- Right here. Here you go.
- Give me.

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:50.470
When I was A Pet in the Heavenly Palace.

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:51.470
No, it won't work.

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:54.390
The Stories

00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:57.750
between Me and My Master.

00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:58.960
Not gonna work either.

00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:01.020
Useful Tips

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:04.230
for Taming My Master.

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:06.200
I heard…

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.420
I heard the writer of this book

00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:09.870
not only helped his Master

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:10.910
successfully ascend to the God Realm

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:12.470
through his hard work,

00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:13.390
but also trained himself

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:14.230
into a senior immortal.

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:15.720
He's got great reputation

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.230
in the immortal beasts' world.

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:20.540
"Restrained by the rules
of the master-servant contract,

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:21.710
spiritual beasts

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:24.200
cannot fight the contract forcibly."

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:25.040
I'm exhausted.

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.820
"Don't be afraid to think outside the box.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.270
Cater to his tastes

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.110
and humor his needs

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:34.720
by praising and encouraging him."

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:35.990
Would you like to take a break?

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:38.020
No.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:39.160
I'll keep this one.

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:40.600
You can go back now.

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:41.990
I'll keep running.

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:43.060
Alright.

00:12:56.900 --> 00:13:00.340
(The entrance, Daze Mountain)

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:12.580
What took you so long?

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:13.630
I've been waiting for you.

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:16.940
Why don't you try running the whole night?

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:19.510
Let's go.

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:23.240
(According to the book,)

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:24.750
(I can't openly defy the master of the contract.)

00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:26.510
(Instead, I should cater to his tastes)

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:27.660
(to get what I want.)

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:29.590
(Let me give it a try.)

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:34.550
You've been saying that you wanted

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:36.300
to try the mung bean cake from the mortal world.

00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:39.600
I learned how to make it
and made some for you last night.

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:40.590
Try it.

00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:42.150
You put poison in it, didn't you?

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:43.940
Why would I do that?

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:45.750
I want to apologize to you

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:47.420
for yesterday.

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.150
Really?

00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:52.390
You made it yourself?

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:54.440
Or what?

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:02.350
Tastes good?

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:05.320
Not bad.

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:09.150
Then about yesterday…

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:11.470
Whether or not

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:13.300
I'll forgive you depends on your behavior.

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:16.020
Make more of this when you have time.

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:18.710
Let's go.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:21.440
Come on.

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:22.630
Coming.

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:40.940
(He forgave me already?)

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:42.590
(Are you kidding?)

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.240
(The tips for taming)

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:45.950
(worked very well.)

00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:47.270
Jin, Yin.

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.040
Senior brother.

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:55.150
Why are you all here?

00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:56.270
You don't have to see us off.

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:57.830
We only go down the mountain
to fetch the immortal energy.

00:14:57.830 --> 00:14:58.670
We'll be back soon.

00:14:58.840 --> 00:14:59.750
And my spiritual power

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.230
has improved a lot.

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:02.660
I can protect myself and her.

00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:03.750
Yin,

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:05.660
make sure to protect Jin well.

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:06.750
We'll count on you.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:08.940
You got it.

00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:10.440
I will take good care of him.

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:11.280
Rest assured.

00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:12.510
Jin,

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:13.720
according to Master's instructions,

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:15.190
Hong Ruo, the Demon Lord of the Fox Clan,

00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:16.910
is very close to Feng Yuan,
the Heavenly Empress,

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:18.270
so you guys can go to the Fox Clan

00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:19.390
in the Jingyou Valley

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:20.630
of the Demon Realm to find the parasol tree first,

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:22.110
and then head to Ziyue Mountain.

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:23.350
Understood.

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.230
The Immortal and the Demon Realms have been
holding a deep grudge against each other.

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:27.350
When you enter the Demon Realm,

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.420
you've got to be extra cautious.

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:30.680
Got it.

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:31.800
We are leaving.

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:33.470
Have a safe trip.

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:34.660
Let's go.

00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:40.390
Congratulations

00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:41.630
on breaking through the Gate of Life and Death

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:43.390
and entering the Third Heaven.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.150
(Back then, my parents)

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:55.350
(fell into the immortals' trap)

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:56.780
(and died in the battle.)

00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:59.780
(The Nirvana Wheel was also taken.)

00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:03.240
(Heize Pool, the Third Heaven, the Demon Realm)
(I must forge a weapon)

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:04.900
(in this Heize Pool for myself,)

00:17:05.830 --> 00:17:07.910
(and then go to the Immortal Realm)

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:09.980
(to get the Nirvana Wheel back.)

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:50.110
The Nirvana Wheel.

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:13.030
Those in the Three Realms

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:14.260
who swallow the energy of their own kind

00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:15.660
will fall and become devils.

00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:17.830
Once a year,

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:19.830
the Half-god Demon Dragon
that guards the Abyssal Prison

00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:22.550
(The Barrier entrance, Abyssal Prison)
will drive the newfound devils

00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:23.790
into the prison.

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:25.720
I want you

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:27.390
to lure Hong Yi

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:29.220
into the prison at that time.

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:52.420
(Abyssal Prison)

00:19:58.160 --> 00:19:59.660
He's mine.

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:25.040
My son,

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:26.940
go under the parasol tree in the southeast.

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:28.940
It's a tree from the God Realm.

00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:30.660
The devils can't hurt it.

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:17.900
(Jingyou Valley, the Second Heaven, the Demon Realm)

00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:25.350
How is it going?

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:27.830
(Hong Mei, Elder of the Fox Clan)
I sent someone to follow His Highness secretly.

00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:30.100
But he suddenly disappeared as soon

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:31.180
as he broke into the Third Heaven.

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:32.430
Have you asked our allies

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:33.500
in the Third Heaven?

00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:34.660
I have.

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:37.180
How could this happen?

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:53.830
I'm Hong Ruo of the Fox Clan
in the Jingyou Mountain.

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:55.740
I came to Ziyue Mountain for an urgent matter.

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:07.220
Ziyue Mountain

00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:09.940
is True God Di Juan's cultivation place.

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:12.350
He has returned to the Ancient God Realm.

00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:13.830
No visitors.

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:14.700
But I…

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:30.300
(The Demon Realm)

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:31.810
So, this is the Demon Realm.

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:32.650
- I think…
- Shh.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.030
Lower your voice, will you?

00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:37.070
Don't blame me for not warning you.

00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:38.070
The Immortal Realm and the Demon Realm

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:39.390
don't get along.

00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:40.400
Your healing power

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:41.240
is quite weak.

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:42.940
You got to be careful, or a demon will attack you,

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:45.060
take your internal core, and devour you.

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:45.900
Got it?

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:51.900
Based on the story books,

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:55.260
there are a lot of dashing

00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:56.830
and handsome demon lords here.

00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:57.830
Is that true?

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:02.310
Look at you, so ignorant.

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:05.430
Those handsome demons you talked about

00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:07.190
are all powerful demons

00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:08.260
who've entered the Second Heaven

00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:09.480
through cultivation,

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:10.900
so they can take on attractive appearances.

00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:13.190
While those ordinary small demons

00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:14.660
can't take on human forms at all.

00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:16.020
They can be very ugly.

00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:18.110
So, which level are we on right now?

00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:21.190
The Second Heaven.

00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:22.180
In that case,

00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:23.680
I do have a chance

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:25.260
to see some handsome demon lords.

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:28.200
Do you still remember

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:29.870
why we came here?

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:33.390
We are here to look
for the immortal energy of Feng Yin.

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:36.590
You look like you are here for a date.

00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:38.940
Don't talk nonsense.

00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:41.440
If I were to date someone,

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:43.310
I'd chose a guy from the Third Heaven.

00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:46.700
The Third Heaven?

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:48.400
The Third Heaven

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:49.980
is the place where the Demon King lives.

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:52.390
But the Ziyue Mountain we are heading

00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:53.870
is actually in the Third Heaven.

00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:55.160
Shall I introduce you

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:57.070
to the Demon King?

00:23:58.200 --> 00:23:59.220
Why…

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:02.660
Why did you reveal your original form?

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:09.900
Change your form back, now.

00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:11.300
If you get caught,

00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:12.900
I won't be able to get you back.
Hurry, change back.

00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:14.260
I can't help.

00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:16.740
The demonic power
in the mountain is too overwhelming.

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:17.900
One hundred years ago,

00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:19.150
the Fox Queen Hong Ruo started to rise.

00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:20.790
Under her leadership, the Fox Clan

00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:22.260
became the biggest clan in the Demon Realm.

00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:24.070
This place is not to be underestimated.

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:27.260
Your comments on our Fox Clan

00:24:27.790 --> 00:24:29.070
makes me feel flattered.

00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:37.430
Come here.

00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:38.700
This demon's got high spiritual power.

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:40.000
I bet he's long sensed

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:40.840
our immortal aura.

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:42.000
We must be careful.

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:44.900
Will he find out about me?

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:46.800
No.

00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:48.350
Before we left,

00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:50.500
I asked Xian Shan to cast a spell on you.

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:52.160
In outsiders' eyes,

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:53.150
you are just

00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:54.630
a spiritual cat.

00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:56.630
A spiritual cat.

00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:58.240
- I…
- Shh.

00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:03.700
I'm Hong Huo.

00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:06.390
May I know who are here

00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:07.830
to visit our Jingyou Mountain?

00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:11.390
We are Gu Jin and Yin

00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:13.190
from Daze Mountain.

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:14.980
We are here to visit Hong Ruo, the Fox Queen.

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:17.260
So, you are Lord Donghua's disciples.

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:19.000
In that case,

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:20.630
please come with me.

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:24.240
Let's go.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.570
Careful. Don't run around.

00:26:29.570 --> 00:26:31.070
So beautiful.

00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:46.390
Stop it.

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:48.200
The disciples of the Daze Mountain

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:49.980
are trained to be righteous and moral.

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:52.460
They won't be easily enchanted.

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:54.350
Remove the spell.

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:06.280
Let's go.

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:13.830
I'm Gu Jin of Daze Mountain.

00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:14.980
Greetings, Your Highness,

00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:16.260
Elders.

00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:22.910
Gu Jin.

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:25.550
You've grown up.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:26.920
Shouldn't you go look

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:28.180
for the immortal energy of Feng Yin?

00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:30.660
What did you come here for?

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:31.790
Actually, that's exactly the reason

00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:33.070
why I'm here.

00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:38.440
This is part of the immortal energy

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:40.000
of Feng Yin I found in a parasol tree

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.350
by accident.

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:42.720
My Master told me

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:44.590
that the rest of the pieces

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:45.830
might scatter in the parasol trees

00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:47.460
in all Three Realms,

00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:48.590
including

00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:52.030
the one in the Jingyou Valley of the Fox Clan.

00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:54.830
So, Your Highness,

00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:56.340
I hope you can let me

00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:57.720
enter the Jingyou Valley

00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:58.830
and take a look.

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:01.830
That's ridiculous.

00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:03.880
The Jingyou Valley is a holy place of our clan

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:05.230
where we breed young.

00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:06.070
How could we let you, an immortal,

00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:06.910
get close to it?

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:08.000
Even if Lord Donghua

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:09.310
came here in person today,

00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:10.510
we wouldn't let him enter,

00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:11.630
let alone you.

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:14.350
We promise we'll only fetch the energy piece.

00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:16.150
We will not touch the parasol tree.

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:19.310
Your Highness,

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:21.310
on the account
of the Heavenly Empress Feng Yuan

00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:22.630
and the Wutong Island,

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:24.090
please allow me to try.

00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:25.500
(Because of him,
my precious disciple Feng Yuan)

00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:27.460
(lost all her immortal energy back then.)

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:28.990
(I can't believe he can still manage)

00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:30.590
(to get the support
from Feng Yuan and Dong Hua.)

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:32.390
(I'm afraid he's not as simple as he seems.)

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:34.700
(Since I can't go into the Ziyue Mountain,)

00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:36.550
(maybe this kid has a way)

00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:37.660
(of entering it.)

00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:39.310
It's not impossible

00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:40.350
for you to enter the Jingyou Valley.

00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:43.030
But you aren't our clansmen,

00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:44.110
I can't make the exception for you

00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:45.350
for no reason

00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:46.880
even on the account

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:47.940
of Feng Yuan.

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:49.350
Then, Your Highness,

00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:50.190
what do you want from us?

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:51.240
Yin.

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:52.740
You are quite smart.

00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:55.390
My nephew Nine-tailed Fox Hong Yi

00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:57.900
went missing in the Ziyue Mountain a while ago.

00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:00.350
If you can help me find him back,

00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:01.940
I'll allow you

00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:03.740
to enter the Jingyou Valley.

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:06.590
Hong Yi went missing in the mountain?

00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:07.870
That's right.

00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:09.940
In the Third Heaven,

00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:12.900
where the origin of Hong Meng
of the Demon Realm is at.

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:13.990
The Demon Realm.

00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:14.830
What do you think?

00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:20.110
Alright.

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:21.540
There's also

00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:22.500
a parasol tree in the Ziyue Mountain,

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:24.110
where we are going to visit anyway.

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:27.940
I'd like to help you find your nephew back.

00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:29.590
Then it's a deal.

00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:30.630
I'll stay here

00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:33.180
and wait for you to bring Hong Yi back.

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:36.030
What kind of a place the Ziyue Mountain is?

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:38.310
Why is everybody afraid of it?

00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:40.010
The Ziyue Mountain

00:29:40.010 --> 00:29:42.330
is the place where Di Juan,

00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:43.350
one of the two True Gods,

00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:44.550
used to dwell.

00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:46.230
The Purple Moon he had

00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:47.900
was the power source
of the entire Demon Realm.

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:49.980
So, the demons were all afraid of him.

00:29:50.550 --> 00:29:51.750
Besides, there's a powerful Barrier

00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:52.700
protecting the mountain.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.470
Those who trespass on it

00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:57.420
will be torn apart by the power of the Barrier.

00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:00.260
In that case,

00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:03.110
how are we supposed to get in?

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:12.550
Princess Hua Shu.

00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:23.400
How dare you

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:24.580
(Yan Shuang, the Princess of the Eagle Clan)
steal from us?

00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:26.070
Hand over the Blue Blood Reishi.

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:27.280
No way.

00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:42.660
The Reishi.

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:45.260
Your Highness.

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:47.320
Sky-shrouding Umbrella.

00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:06.940
Your Highness, are you alright?

00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:08.430
I'm fine.

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:10.520
Come on.

00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:17.350
Five against one.

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:19.180
It's so unfair.

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:21.030
Who are you?

00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:23.180
Gu Jin of Daze Mountain.

00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:24.500
Yin of Daze Mountain.

00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:25.910
Fine.

00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:27.900
I, Yan Shuang, will remember you two.

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:29.240
Let's go.

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:40.390
Thank you, Jin.

00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:41.950
Don't mention it.

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:44.040
Your Highness,

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:45.110
who are

00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:46.070
those people?

00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:47.590
Why did they fight you over that thing?

00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:50.350
My father's immortal energy was damaged

00:31:51.270 --> 00:31:52.550
after fighting the Eagle King.

00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:55.660
In the Three Realms,

00:31:56.030 --> 00:31:57.240
only the Blue Blood Reishi

00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:58.460
can heal his injury.

00:31:59.310 --> 00:32:00.900
To kill my father, the Eagle Clan

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:02.740
kept trying to take it from me,

00:32:03.510 --> 00:32:04.740
or destroy it if they can't have it.

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:07.260
The Eagle Clan has gone too far.

00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:09.940
The one you saw

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:12.150
is Yan Shuang, the Princess of the Eagle Clan.

00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:14.030
As the Princess

00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:15.110
of the Bainiao Island,

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:16.590
I've never thought

00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:18.260
I'd be bullied like this.

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:22.520
Your Highness,

00:32:22.790 --> 00:32:24.310
you are injured.

00:32:24.510 --> 00:32:25.870
Let's find an inn

00:32:25.870 --> 00:32:26.900
so you can take a rest.

00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:32.670
Your Highness,

00:32:33.550 --> 00:32:34.460
put this on.

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:39.030
- Here.
- Thanks.

00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:40.560
Let's go.

00:32:49.030 --> 00:32:50.590
It's quite warm, isn't it?

00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:02.390
Careful.

00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:16.670
Your Highness, rest well.

00:33:16.670 --> 00:33:17.740
We'll leave now.

00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:18.580
Thank you.

00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:19.590
Let's go.

00:33:24.270 --> 00:33:25.660
Your Highness, you are suffering
from an internal injury.

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:27.630
You need to take some spiritual herbs.

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:28.800
Yin,

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:30.350
go get some spiritual herbs.

00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:33.000
Me?

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:36.150
I need to stay here and take care of her.

00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:37.670
Go on.

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:44.590
Thank you, Yin.

00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:46.550
I really appreciate it.

00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:48.190
You are welcome.

00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:52.660
Come back soon.

00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:10.300
But,

00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:11.950
Your Highness, you've long reached

00:34:11.950 --> 00:34:13.030
the level of Junior Immortal, right?

00:34:13.670 --> 00:34:16.030
How come your spiritual power is still weak?

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:21.220
The Eagle Clan has been fighting me
over the Blue Blood Reishi,

00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:23.470
and my father's life is in danger.

00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:25.630
I had to use my own spiritual power

00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:27.820
to protect my father's Spiritual Core.

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:29.910
Then how are you supposed to defend yourself?

00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:31.470
I can't worry about that for now.

00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:37.070
I've got to go back.

00:34:38.070 --> 00:34:39.950
Otherwise, the Eagle Clan
will attack our island again

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:41.630
if they find out I'm not there.

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:46.990
Gu Jin is such an idiot.

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:48.950
He totally threw himself

00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:50.300
at her feet as soon as he saw her.

00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:52.150
He'll be in big trouble.

00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:54.150
But it's none of my business.

00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:55.430
Let him be.

00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:57.950
There's nothing I can do anyway.

00:35:05.550 --> 00:35:06.390
Jin.

00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:14.950
Didn't I just walk past here a minute ago?

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:21.760
Your Highness,

00:35:22.590 --> 00:35:24.050
you aren't recovered yet.

00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:26.130
Even if you go back now, you still can't…

00:35:26.130 --> 00:35:27.950
I must do whatever it takes

00:35:28.590 --> 00:35:29.830
to protect

00:35:29.830 --> 00:35:30.700
my clansmen.

00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:32.510
Worse comes to the worst,

00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:35.630
if I agree to marry
into the immortal clan of the South Sea,

00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:37.150
our Bainiao Island

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:39.310
will no longer

00:35:39.310 --> 00:35:40.260
be supportless

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:41.820
and helpless like this.

00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:43.510
How could you agree to such an arrangement

00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:45.430
at the cost of your own happiness?

00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:46.550
I'll only go for it

00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:48.030
as the last resort.

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:49.700
You don't have to worry.

00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:52.340
I've been training hard lately.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:53.940
Maybe

00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:55.470
I can find a shortcut

00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:56.340
to improve my cultivation base quickly.

00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:57.310
At that time,

00:35:57.310 --> 00:35:58.910
the Eagle Clan will have to stand down.

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:08.240
Your Highness,

00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:09.550
I'll lend you

00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:10.550
the Sky-shrouding Umbrella.

00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:13.380
I think with the protection
of the Umbrella barrier,

00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:15.700
your clan can absolutely
defend against the enemy.

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:18.280
Jin.

00:36:20.030 --> 00:36:21.150
Don't look at me like this.

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:23.030
Just an umbrella. It's no big deal.

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:25.030
What matters right now is to solve the crisis

00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:25.910
that the Bainiao Island is facing.

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:27.260
Please take it.

00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:28.950
I really appreciate

00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:30.700
your kindness and help.

00:36:52.070 --> 00:36:53.110
Jin.

00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:59.390
I'm here.

00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:01.030
Yin.

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:03.320
Yin.

00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:05.590
I'm here.

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:07.430
Where are you?

00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:09.590
This inn is like a maze.

00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:17.070
So dumb.

00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:21.070
Master-servant contract?

00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:24.310
Isn't Yin

00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:25.320
Lord Donghua's

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:26.180
registered disciple?

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:27.380
How come…

00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:31.340
Yin's spiritual power is weak,

00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:33.320
so my Master asked me to protect her

00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:34.260
in this way.

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:36.700
Yin has never

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.030
left Daze Mountain before.

00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:39.390
She has no any sense of direction.

00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:41.030
I may as well just summon her back directly.

00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:43.550
I see.

00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:57.160
Come back.

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:04.950
You are so silly.

00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:06.270
How could you get lost

00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:07.180
in a small inn like this?

00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:08.020
Couldn't you find your way?

00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:09.950
No, I…

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:14.820
Here you go.

00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:20.120
Alright,

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:21.220
stay here.

00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:22.150
Don't run around anymore.

00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:24.160
Your Highness,

00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:25.390
I'll let the waiter

00:38:25.390 --> 00:38:26.340
to decoct the medicine for you.

00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:28.030
Thank you.

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:31.590
What are you looking at?

00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:33.950
Take care of Her Highness.

00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:41.340
Your Highness, would you like some water?

00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:42.350
No need.

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:44.260
I still have things to do. I've got to go.

00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:45.740
Hold on.

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:48.820
He went to decoct the medicine for you.

00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:50.860
If he comes back and sees that you've left,

00:38:51.110 --> 00:38:52.380
he'll go through the trouble for nothing.

00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:53.390
Why don't you wait for him?

00:38:53.590 --> 00:38:55.150
You can leave after he's back.

00:38:57.550 --> 00:38:58.660
I don't need a servant like you

00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:00.910
to tell me what to do.

00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:03.740
He told you that?

00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:06.060
How I talk to your master

00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:07.340
and what we talk about

00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:08.740
is none of your concern.

00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:10.320
As a servant,

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:12.340
you should focus on doing your job right.

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:27.470
The medicine is ready.

00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:36.180
Where's Princess Hua Shu?

00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:37.870
She left.

00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:38.950
Left?

00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:41.820
She… She's still wounded.

00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:44.230
Yin, I told you to keep her stay.

00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:45.070
How?

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:46.800
As a servant,

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:47.700
I should focus on my own job.

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:49.550
Do I have the right to interfere in the matter

00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:51.470
between my master and the princess? No.

00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:53.180
What's wrong?

00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:55.990
Why are you mad?

00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:57.510
Did I do something?

00:39:58.710 --> 00:40:00.590
Why did you tell Hua Shu

00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:02.740
about the master-servant contract thing?

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:05.430
Because you were looking for me.

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:07.870
I wanted to summon you back,

00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:08.990
so I uttered the spell,

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:10.630
and Hua Shu saw it through.

00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:13.320
Don't worry.

00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:15.030
Princess Hua Shu is pretty and kind.

00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:16.380
She wouldn't think too much of it.

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:19.660
She just…

00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:21.390
She…

00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:24.180
Pretty and kind.

00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:25.990
Back then on the Wutong Island,

00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:27.360
she helped me

00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:28.950
when she didn't even know me.

00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:30.860
Apparently, she's a kind-hearted person.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.260
Come on, don't be mad.

00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:37.640
Yin.

00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:47.800
Actually,

00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:49.340
I got hurt too

00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:50.820
when I tried to save her.

00:40:51.590 --> 00:40:52.550
It really hurts.

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:55.340
You deserve it.

00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:06.510
Good.

00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:08.160
I feel much better now.

00:41:09.230 --> 00:41:10.070
I knew

00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:11.400
our Yin

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:12.320
still cared deeply about me.

00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:13.210
Not really.

00:41:13.230 --> 00:41:15.110
I was just worried that you'd slow me down.

00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:16.640
You big fool.

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:17.960
All you can think about

00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:19.260
is Hua Shu.

00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:20.750
You got hurt for saving her life,

00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:21.590
yet she left

00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:22.700
without even saying goodbye to you.

00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:24.300
Don't you think it's strange?

00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:26.510
She's worried about the Bainiao Island.

00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:27.740
You still need to go

00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:28.860
to the Ziyue Mountain for a mission.

00:41:29.070 --> 00:41:30.700
You don't have time
to concern about the Bainiao Island.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:31.860
How could you…

00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:33.430
Look how worried you are.

00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:35.280
Alright,

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:36.840
I'll

00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:38.110
stop pretending.

00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:39.600
Yes,

00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:40.550
it's true that ordinary people

00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:42.660
dare not approach the Ziyue Mountain,

00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:44.470
but I'm no ordinary person.

00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:47.790
I'm very resourceful.

00:41:47.790 --> 00:41:49.740
With my power and strength,

00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:50.870
I can easily

00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:52.190
take you into

00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:53.110
the Ziyue Mountain.

00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:56.280
Really?

00:41:56.590 --> 00:41:57.430
You bet.

00:41:58.230 --> 00:41:59.910
I'll be damned if I believe you.

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:01.700
You don't? Come with me.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.210
I'm not going.

00:42:03.210 --> 00:42:04.260
Why not? Come on.

00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:05.920
I'll show you

00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:06.860
my true power.

00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:15.340
So, this is the Ziyue Mountain.

00:42:18.110 --> 00:42:19.070
The demonic aura here is so strong.

00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:20.880
No matter ordinary immortals and demons

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:21.740
dare not to get close to it.

00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:23.030
Tell me about it.

00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:25.060
Without permission,

00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:26.300
ordinary half-gods aren't allowed in at all.

00:42:27.150 --> 00:42:28.660
But it's different

00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:29.510
when it comes to me.

00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:31.070
Watch.

00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:35.070
You'll just go in like this?

00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:36.350
Or what?

00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:37.720
Don't worry.

00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:39.340
I've got a trump card.

00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:41.860
But you should at least prepare a visiting note.

00:42:42.110 --> 00:42:43.320
It's rude for you to go in like this.

00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:44.550
Who are you?

00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:46.740
How dare you trespass on the Ziyue Mountain?

00:42:54.070 --> 00:42:55.230
It's you,

00:42:55.230 --> 00:42:56.740
you three-headed guy.

00:42:57.710 --> 00:42:58.550
Don't you recognize me?

00:42:58.880 --> 00:42:59.740
Watch your mouth.

00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:01.990
I'm the Dragon Lord guarding the mountain.

00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:04.740
You are insolent and impudent.

00:43:05.070 --> 00:43:06.260
Get lost, now.

00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:15.910
This is the trump card you talked about?

00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:17.070
I…

00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:21.350
I know Bibo.

00:43:21.350 --> 00:43:22.220
Bibo.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:27.840
Stop.

00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:29.400
(Bibo, Water Divine Beast)

00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:30.590
You stupid dragon.

00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:32.260
Are you blind even with six eyes?

00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:34.180
If you hurt my…

00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:38.800
The cousin of the neighbor

00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:40.300
of the distant nephew of my seventh aunt,

00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:41.820
I'll make you pay for it.

00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:50.260
(Three-headed Fire Dragon)

00:43:53.230 --> 00:43:54.950
- I'm also…
- Are you alright?

00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:56.600
I'm fine.

00:43:58.190 --> 00:43:59.270
My nephew,

00:43:59.270 --> 00:44:00.280
it's been over 100 years.

00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:01.500
You finally came to visit me.

00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:02.700
I missed you so much.

00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:03.950
Give me a hug.

00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:10.260
I'm also… I…

00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:15.200
Bibo.

00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:16.430
Have you ever seen

00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:19.110
a Nine-tailed Fox in the Ziyue Mountain?

00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:28.820
(Bibo Hut, the Ziyue Mountain)

00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:29.820
I've searched telepathically,

00:44:32.590 --> 00:44:33.480
and there are no traces

00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:35.350
of a Nine-tailed Fox here.

00:44:35.350 --> 00:44:36.260
No?

00:44:36.670 --> 00:44:37.510
How's that possible?

00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:39.550
The Fox Queen Hong Ruo was pretty sure

00:44:39.550 --> 00:44:41.590
that her nephew went into the Ziyue Mountain.

00:44:43.070 --> 00:44:44.470
If he's not here,

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:46.100
how are we supposed to go to the Jingyou Valley

00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:47.340
to find the immortal energy of the Fire Phoenix?

00:44:49.550 --> 00:44:50.390
Bibo,

00:44:50.670 --> 00:44:52.380
before my Master ascended to the God Realm,

00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:54.100
he told me there's also

00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:55.030
a parasol tree in the Ziyue Mountain.

00:44:55.710 --> 00:44:56.860
There is one.

00:44:57.230 --> 00:44:58.070
But,

00:44:58.150 --> 00:44:58.990
why do you ask?

00:44:59.150 --> 00:45:01.590
The Fire Phoenix's immortal energy
shattered because of me.

00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:03.190
My Master said her immortal energy

00:45:03.190 --> 00:45:04.990
could scatter in the parasol trees.

00:45:05.550 --> 00:45:06.590
You want me to take you

00:45:06.590 --> 00:45:07.430
to the tree?

00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:08.550
That's right.

00:45:09.150 --> 00:45:10.020
No.

00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:11.030
We can't go there.

00:45:11.550 --> 00:45:12.390
Why not?

00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:15.870
Because the parasol tree in the Ziyue Mountain

00:45:15.870 --> 00:45:17.430
is not at a usual place.

00:45:17.710 --> 00:45:18.990
It's in

00:45:19.710 --> 00:45:21.430
the Abyssal Prison.

00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:23.300
